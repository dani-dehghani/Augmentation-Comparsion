1,"without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image ! "

1,all in all though i 'm very happy with my new mp3 player . 
0,The only problem I have with the buttons is that the power button and print/share button don't have a nice click.

1,The guide fence for freehand routing is well made and solid.

1,you actually can talk to a real person for support in under an hour!).
1,"In low light with flash I found it clear better then the sony P200 (too much red, colours overall not as natural but fewer red-eyes). "
1,"These include: MP3, Wave, WMA, WMA Pro, and WMA Lossless; it is very user-friendly simply by right-clicking the file(s) to be converted. "
1,The height adjustment works well- not perfect.
1, Nice and compact .
1," I do n't for-see myself having any issues with it in the coming year or two however if I do , I will know that with this product , it will be taken care of for free and quick with helpful and courteous customer service reps.

1," UPDATE Jan 12 , 2012 The device has worked flawlessly for the past year ."
1," This set is not my preferred to use in my car -LRB- I use the JBL On Tour - great sound for a small , compact speaker -RRB- , but I was very impressed with the Phillip speaker sound and use them very regularly around the house ."
1,the earbuds that come with it are n't that bad . 
1,The use of 65536 (16bit) colors ensures you get your share of animations and icons on your phone

1,"it is n't big and offensive , though you would n't know it by looking at the pics it takes . "
1," It worked perfectly for about a week , then the problems came ."
0,Now this router is not the cheapest on the market.  
0," The data rate over the network storage is rather slow , but I only use it for occasional backups so it does n't bother me too much ."
1," However , you DO get what you pay for in reliable products ."
1,  However after purchasing a 20 GB iPod it's clear to see the superiority. 
0,"in fact , it caused my system to hang more times than not , so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource 100 % . "
0,"one bad thing though , i find the remote-control a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably ' die ' before the player does . "

1," I got this for use on my truck and I 'm happy with it for the most part , it is loud and super easy to install , however you are going to want an amp for i"
