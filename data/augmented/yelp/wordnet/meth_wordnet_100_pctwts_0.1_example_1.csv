5,"This is a great little hidden gem! From the outside, it looks like just a dive but the inside is surprisingly nice.  The food here is great and they are willing to make things to your taste when it comes to ingredients and spice level.  The waitstaff are also very friendly. They came by while we were eating just to make sure we were happy with everything even though this is an ""order at the counter"" place. Another little bonus is that they have a drink station where guests can help themselves to free refills which definitely comes in handy in Phoenix!"

4,Good place and food Id very good for bar food. A bit pricey but good atmosphere. heavy service.
4,"They have plenty of equipment so there should never be a wait for anything. They offer great classes, although they tend to get too full sometimes. It would be nice if there was a restroom up front so you dont have to walk through the entire shower/locker room if all you need to do is pee!"
3,"Live entertainment, friendly, restroom clean, my dish was good, but my hubbies dish the meat was not seasoned at all and for a fajita they gave him a burrito flour size tortilla and took about 15 mins to bring a second one.  Plus hrs are posted wrong on yelp. States open from 6 am to 2 pm even though they serve breakfast, lunch and dinner."

5,"I realize L&L is a chain, but I love their food. My favorites are the Loco Moco and the BBQ Chicken. I also enjoy their haupia-filled donuts. The family that runs this place is very friendly and do a great job in making sure you will enjoy your meal. Go there."
2,"I was so disappointed in this place. I just moved out here and was craving filipino food and found this place based on reviews. Although the reviews were average, I was hoping to catch this place on one of its good days. Nope, not the case.  The place is not much to look at and the food did not look good. I was hesitant to eat here but was so hungry and saw that they had my fav dishes, sinigang and diniguan. They were both ok, Ive def had better. I ordered the pancit for my husband and it was terrible! He had maybe two bites and threw the rest away.  Oh well, wont be coming back here. Theres another filipino place in Phoenix so well be trying that next. Gingeroot, also in Chandler, is way better but expensive. Guess its worth the price when you have your cravings!"

3,"I think Marcellinos will get a second chance for a special occasion.  I visited the restaurant based on seeing it on Check Please Arizona.  The food is obviously made fresh and was excellent but I felt a little overpriced based on other excellent restaurants in the area.  Although the atmosphere was romantic, I had a hard time reading the menu and the bill using just the votive candle on the table.  There has to be a better way!"
2,The food was ok.  Waitress forgot my guacamole.  Wait staff continually bumped into our table.  Great wine list.  Nice decor.  I may or may not try again.  Not impressed by the food. Id go up to Narcisse or True Food instead.

4,"I didnt really ""get it"". I was expecting more Island style food, or more adventurous treats. *  Bar was great. *  Tuna Poke thing was fantastic. *  Cajun burger was terrific, but the bun was too dense and troublesome. *  Chicken CocoaJoe was a bust.  Chicken a little dry and under-seasoned, rice and beans were bland (needs a giant ham-hock and about 3 more days).  The Plaintain was overflavored, but underseasoned (they dont neem much more than salt and time). Awesome location. Menu will expand I am sure. Repaint the bathroom please."

3,"I give this place 3 stars because of how friendly the lady that worked there was and how amazing their prices were. It was pretty unorganized though and I am sure that it is due to people moving books to where they shouldnt be and there just being too many books to keep organized. It is not a bad book store at all, just be prepared to have to dig and dig for what you are looking for. Worth it though for the prices :)"
3,"The people who are either stocking the shelves, cleaning the floors, or behind the counter have all been polite so far. I have nothing really bad to say, but nothing really great either. Keep perservering...maybe Ill write another review when something outrageous happens :)"

5,Best Subway anywhere. Super-friendly staff and always really clean!
3,Met up with a group of friends here on a Monday night... a big group. Although Keegans had no notice of our mob arrival they did well with service etc. Beers were poured fast; food took a little extra time but with a group our size that is to be expected. The outside patio space was great on a warm AZ night... a friend got the sliders and said they were quite tasty when they finally arrived. The happy hour prices are okay with a nice choice of beers and mixed cocktails.

1,The Duce is a disaster.  As an Arizona native and a downtown local I root for cool interesting places downtown. I wanted to love this place. The 1st time we tried the Duce I was extremely let down by the customer service. The parking is atrocious. Its as if you are inconveniencing the staff by asking where you order food. They were out of just about everything we wanted to order. So disappointing.  However I decided to give them a second shot. Everyone has a rough night. We went to an event there last night the entertainment by Scandalesque was AMAZING... same TERRIBLE customer service from the staff at the Duce. Management needs to wake up. Great concept. Horrific customer service and staff.
1,"Water park is OK.  However, the parking lot has ZERO security.  No security patrols, no cameras.  My catalytic converters were stolen off my truck in the parking lot at Big Surf Tempe today.  Sawed right off in broad daylight.  According to the cops, car break ins and catalytic converter thefts happen frequently here.  BEWARE!  The water park management doesnt give a shit.  Even the cop laughs because they always say the same thing:  ""Our camera is broken but its getting fixed next week"".  What a joke.  If you go, have someone drop you off.  Youve been warned!"

4,"I still like Lux better. Cartel is very appealing, though, to those who know their coffee. The menu is not huge, but it does offer basic, good drinks.  They have plenty of syrups to flavor your drinks, if thats what youre into. I like the atmosphere in there, and the bike wheel ""art"" is pretty interesting and unique. This place is probably really great to study in, considering the fact that I see a sea of macbook apples every time I walk in here.  The employees are funny and nice. Anyway, it is definitely worth checking out."
3,"For quick fast food.. this is my choice.. I usually call ahead and get take out.. Dont expect super friendly.. but its just take out.. not clear table service.. even if you stay.. I always get the chicken salad with sesame vinagrette on the side but I will say, Im not a fan of the pungent dressing.. I get the chile sauce instead.. vietnamese rolls.. and its not so unhealthy.. NOW my friends that usually nosh with me.. hate the foods they get.. they say it every time I suggest this place.. who knows? Since I  havent really tried anything from my norm salad.. I cant say.. but for me its a strong 3.."

1,"Tried a couple Tammie Coe cupcakes and a mini muffin two weeks ago... Unfortunately for them, I also sampled Ollie Cakes... No wonder Ollie Cakes, aka Urban Cookie, won Cupcake Wars and Tammie Coe sits in high rent selling pretty sugar disguised as a cupcake. Drive a few miles north, get whatever the special cupcake of the day is along with a Brown Velvet and Lemon, and save saying you enjoyed Tammie Coe for impressing snooty folk who wouldnt know yummy if it bit them on the butt! Really, the TC cakes were just cakes... No flavor, no texture, dry... And I cant say how impressed I was that the clerk shoved all my selections into one, tiny, flat bag meant for cookies or sandwiches!  Apparently presentation and flavor preservation mean nothing... As their products now do, at least to me."

5,"Great selection of vitamins and supplements, good prices and I can get the special treats our cat likes while Im picking up the goods for myself. Plus their rewards program is pretty straightforward. I also like that they are not ""all over you"" like the other local chain is when you walk in the door.  I highly recommend the Vitamin Shoppe on Camelback!"
4,"Back in August we went on a Sat night ..we got our skate on good !  8 bucks total ( But i have my own skates) 2 dollar skate rental ( i think)  Great Dj was spinning classics ..i love roller -disco .totally took me back to my disco days ..also played a great mix of music in general . it was super fun. place needs some sprucing up ...but it wouldnt stop me from returning ,especially for some old school fun."

3,"This was the first and only Thai place Ive been to in AZ.  Overall, it is pretty good.  I think we will probably try a new place next time but if we cant find anything better, I think we wont have any problem going back to Swaddee. *Price = on the high-end  *Pad Thai = pretty good volume *Green Curry = very good. *Garlic delight = The portion is way too small to charge $11"
1,"Disclaimer: I am a Thai person and a Thai food connoisseur.  This is supremely average Thai food and overpriced as heck to take advantage of White People. Sorry to be blunt but thats all it is. $18 dishes that are $8 at a real Thai restaurant. The spring rolls were very bland and came with only a tiny bit of sauce for dipping. They should also include on the table a selection of fish sauces and spices to add to your meals and appetizers. They dont have. If you like spicy, skip it for sure. Again this is what we would call Tourist Thai back in Thailand.  Tiny servings. The good. Friendly wait staff. If authentic Thai is what youre looking for try any of these: Palees Crown, Tum Nak Thai or Royal Thai Grill."

1,"First off, the restaurant is dim and dark.. I thought the decor was a little off because they were going for a tropical Vietnam theme with banana trees in there and a waterfall fountain. The waiter there did not have a smile and didnt seem freindly, it looked like this was the last place he wanted to be at. The service sucked ass. I mean come on, there was only two tables including mines and 3.9/4 of the time, he didnt check up on us or refilled our water and we had to walk up to ask for our bill.. like seriously...? Are you that lazy. Bun Bo Hue was skimpy on the meat and had little veggies on the side. Pho had a rancid smell. Noodles in my sisters bun thit nuong were hard and watery (seemed like they were super old) Overall, I wouldnt recommend to ANYBODY."
2,"I really wanted to like this place, but the service just ruined it.  I went on a sunday afternoon, when it really wasnt that busy. I was sitting directly at the bar and still got poor service. The server walked by probably 5 times while my glass set empty before she made eye contact with me. It was a bit ridiculous.  I feel like the yardhouse had just as many (if not more) taps, with the same prices and better service.  Great decor though, very tall open ceilings and lots of TVs. Just dont expect good service."

3,"I wasnt sure what to expect. This was stop 1 on the pub crawl.  There was an emo looking couple in a booth a table full of patrons (they looked like regulars) The artwork on the walls was dark and ecclectic, but the place didnt have a dark feel. I cant say this would be ""my"" bar. But if I were in the neighborhood I would go to this bar for a few drinks and some hummus."

Weve been coming to Fez for awhile now we normally order just the entrees, we were surprised at how terrible the appetizers were.  Majority of the food was left uneaten."

Drinks are cheap, I was shocked at how low the bill was at the end of the night after buying rounds of drinks until our party got their buzz on, but maybe its just me used to Hollywood prices. T_T Out in LA you get used to paying for parking, cover and then exorbitant prices for drinks.   I love their signature cherry vodka drink, its tasty! Its kinda like a Shirley Temple?! Service at the bar was quick for the amount of people there. Plenty of room for dancing which is always a plus."

Why were my wings not charged an additional $1.50?  I understand their thought process but we were not hungry enough to order 2 dishes and waste food.  Also, for a sports bar on a Friday night, I expect beers to be continually full, not waiting 10 minutes in between.  Ill be back for the wings and for a change but the customer service definitely will be remembered."

And the produce department is crazy!  2 lbs of grapes for 99 cents, 8 cucumbers for a dollar, 17 cents for a bunch of cilantro, 7 -- YES, SEVEN pounds of watermelon for 99 cents.  You can go crazy with produce and not break the bank.   The tamales are huge and the tortillas, oh the tortillas.  Dont be frightened, dont get intimidated, its just a grocery store people!"

4,"Tasty Kabob is kind of a throw away name, but the service and food are excellent. The hummus is good, not the best I have ever had, but it is better than many places I have been to. The chicken kabob was excellent, I am not sure how they spice the chicken shwarma, but it is excellent. I had the gyro platter and that was also excellent.  What I really do not understand is why Pita Jungle is so packed and this place is empty. The food is more authentic and frankly tastes better in my opinion. No more Pita Jungle for me. When I am in the area, I will go to Tasty Kabob."

Several times I waited too long.  One time I went up there and there was no one working there.  I should have just put on an apron and walked behind the bar myself and made my own drink.  Still, they have an awesome set up outside for enjoying the warm Phoenix nights.  I dont understand why the band has to play inside.  I guess people who live nearby complained about the noise.  Then dont live next to a f*cking bar!!! Idiots."

Several sentence I waited too long.  One time I went up there and there was no ane working there.  single should have just put on an apron and walked behind the bar myself and build my own drink.  Still, they have an awesome arrange up outside for enjoying the warm Phoenix nights.  I dont understand why the band has to play inside.  I hazard people who live nearby complained about the noise.  then dont live next to a f*cking bar!!! Idiots."

5,"I am a big fan of this place, either to stop in on a slow Sunday just to see what they have.  Their stock rotates pretty frquently so always new interesting things to find.  So far Ive bought a vintage print, an awesome dress that I have received tons of compliments on, cool earrings, and some other kitchen items.  The staff are always friendly.  When you go, make sure you check out the Burt Reynolds beefcake poster they have behind the counter. Great strore!"

5,"Yes, this place can be a bit pricey, however if you catch them at happy hour or on ""girls night out"" it can be very affordable. The atmosphere and the ""specialness"" of the melting pot is unbeatable. I have been there for intimate occasions, and family birthdays. Food is wonder, especially the cheese! The menu has changed a bit over the years, and there are some oldies I would love to see return (the mushroom salad), but there is nothing that beats this place for any special occasion"

5,"Just came from there as part of my trip down the Apache Trail. My 9year old daughter loved it so much she insisted on stopping in again on the way back. The town is really cute with tons of photo ops. We picked up a few fun souveniers and some prickly pear fudge. We did this in 100 degree temps and still enjoyed it. For those curmudgeons moaning about this being a tourist trap, RELAX....the kids love it. This 40 something mom loved it. Its free to just walk around.  But definitely do the Mystery Shack. Weird and fun. I actually got dizzy in it."
2,"Try as I might I cannot give this place a thumbs-up. Ive likely been in D&E 30 times over the last 10 years, always wanting to give them another chance. They are close-by and the food is above average. But the service ALWAYS sucks. I seriously wonder if the servers are TRAINED to ignore customers. Im not referring to when it is BUSY, Im talking weeknights with a very light crowd. They all must be independently wealthy, is the only thing I can guess."

4,"Great place for happy hour and drinks.  Really cant beat pints at $2.50, good long happy hour 7 days a week.  The sandwiches are all good, the salads make great sides instead of the chips and the tiny cherry sized tomatoes are to die for whether you get it on the bruchetta or cheese board plate.  Thursday late happy hour gets pretty busy and so does friday late afternoon into late evening.  Saturday night it picks up after happy hour ends.  Wish they had burgers and fries like the Living Room in downtown Phoenix."
2,"Ive always said if the guacamole, chips and salsa arent good, the food is not likely to be good either.  I was right, Guacamole was not very good at all, same with the salsa.  Rest of the food was just okay but for a restaurant in the Biltmore I expected so much better.  Just as a note, when it comes to Mexican food, Im super critical.  This place will probably get a higher ratings from people of the Midwest."

4,You know......first when my girl dragged me here....i thought it will suck. Once I stepped in....well....BAM! Interesting colors fill my senses. I do appreciate the set up of this place and the quirky items I found. So yea it is a chick store but still managed to entertain me.
5,"The message I received was drip is toast. I dont drink coffee... a terrible character fault, I know... but Gina and her partner are wonderful hosts and have made a cozy little space to serve delicious food and drinks (I get the chai tea with soy milk.) I like that computers are no where to be seen, only happy people eating and drinking and enjoying conversation. This is a lovely little place, a gem. I enjoy every visit. It is especially nice to bring new people in that havent been before (so invite a friend to brunch because it is a nice surprise.) The service is great, the food is made fresh, and everything Ive tried is delicious, even my five year old loved her nutella on toast. Good things come in small packages and toast illustrates this perfectly."

There are a couple bars to sit at and they even open a big door to a bar for the outside too.  They have some good brews on tap and have flat screen tvs as well.   I have only had a burger and fries here.  They burger was really good, the fries were really greasy and were just okay. The staff here is friendly & speedy.  I would recommend this place for a good place for someone looking for a nice place to grab a drink and converse."

One employee on break sat in front of a small TV in the seating area which was VERY LOUD and ANNOYING. Every table was dirty despite it not being very busy, and the bottles of condiments at the ""fixins"" bar were filthy. Cant beat the prices, though. As usual, I left ""stuft"" on two bucks."

I like the sauce options at Wild Wings and the and the wings are meaty. I had the Parmesan Garlic and the Asian Zing. Its also cool that small portions are available so I was able to order 2 versions. I was able to tolerate the Asian Zing, so maybe Ill try the mild or even medium classic versions next time. My hubby ordered the Jerk Chicken Sandwich and he really liked it. The onion rings were pretty darn good, too.  The only thing negative on this visit was the sucky Berry Lemonade made with Minute Maid Lemonade, I thought for the price it would have been fresh squeezed, but alas I did not read the small type."
4,"Its a chain, but eating with my fingers, whats not to like. Im a chicken in the spicy department so, I dont often eat buffalo hot wings because everyone Im with society the ""hot"" ones.  I like the sauce options at barbaric fly and the and the wings are meaty. I had the Parmesan Garlic and the Asian Zing. Its also cool that low portions are useable so I was able to order 2 versions. I was able to tolerate the Asian pizzazz, so maybe Ill judge the balmy or even medium classic versions next time. My hubby ordered the Jerk Chicken Sandwich and he really liked it.

5,"Old school style butcher shop that has great service and a great selection.  You will pay more, but you can sign up for their emails and get the monthly and weekend specials.  Often there are coupons for BOGO or a few bucks off your purchase.  They also have a good selection of beer and wine, side dishes, and some supplies for home BBQ and smoking.  After reading the other reviews, I know my hubby and I need to try the jerky.  We always enjoy shopping at Von Hansons."
3,"Again, its a bit unfair of me to rate this restaurant because Im from San Jose/Cupertino but Im gonna do it anyway. So, being from San Jose/Cupertino, Ive had me some good Chinese food and even better dim sum. So when the Boyfriend brought me here, I was expecting something decent, but not anything too authentic. This place was fairly decent and authentic! It has the Asian ladies and their dim sum carts. It has the OG dim sum dishes. It even has the authentic less than mediocre Asian service.  The only disappointment is that this place is a bit dirty and ragged-y looking. And the vegetable dishes are minimal. In fact, I had to order a veg dish off the menu because they didnt have any dim sum veg dishes and it cost $13! Bleh."

2,"Would normally give this place 4 stars as I have been a regular here for about a year.  Cheap drinks, great crowd and great music. Except I had my first bad experience here the other sunday.  Granted, me and all the other people from my work were pretty loud after a sunday afternoon spring training game.  Maybe it was the girls being a little too giggly or us just having too much fun for a dive bar...but I think none of that warrants the bartender calling us cheap and rude.  Come on now, we are all servers and we all tipped you well.  Whats with the attitude?  Will still continue to come to this place once I stave off the embarrassment of telling people from work I know about this cool bar only to be so rudely treated by a way too snobby for a sunday afternoon bartender."
1,I dont get it. This place is crazy busy with no Manager in sight and in hiding during the busy dinner hour. No name tags on the employees. I was scolded for pointing over the sneeze glass to the sauce that I wanted since nothing was labeled. I guess I violated the health code. Thanks for not locking me up. I told my family we will not spend one more dime here.

1,Donuts are worst Ive ever had. I bought 2 dozen donuts using their 10.99 sale and it was the worst donuts I have ever had in my life. All the donuts were dry and stale. I should have gone a couple of miles over and bought Krispy Kreme. Krispy Kreme donuts are always fresh. These ones were worst that those that sat on the shelf for a week in a supermarket!
5,"Ah what a beauty and wonder Camelback mountain is. However I do warn beginners to use the easier trail on the East side near Invergorden which runs north south and turns into 64th st. It is a bit of a walk from the parking through the neighborhood but the hike is less treacherous and much easier and takes you up a gradual slope to the top. Be very careful its easy to loose the trail on that side too.  Of course all the Phoenicians like to go to Echo Canyon at Mcdonald and 44th street bend. Parking can be bad at peak times on weekends--I definetely recommend late afternoon hiking, less exhaustion from heat, less crowds and a glorious sunset at the top.  Happy Hiking my Dear Phoenicians."

1,"We came here for dinner for me and reverse happy hour for my wife, we ordered our appetizers and after finishing them and looking over the menu for a few minutes we were ready to jump into the overpriced entrees. We were then informed that we couldnt order dinner. Maybe when they see someone coming in and telling them they are...here for dinner...they might give them a heads up that the kitchen Is closing so we can order our meals and not be told five minutes after it did close..fourth time weve given this place a and got crappy service. Bartender got a buck tip and we had to go find another restaurant for dinner, Needless to say we wont be giving them another chance. Not good Gordon B. Not good."

1,"We ordered $40 worth of pizza for takeout and it took almost 2 hours -- was told 20 minutes. We were not compd for anything. When I expressed my dissatisfaction, they offered to give me $40 credit toward my next order. I asked for this in writing, and they gave me the ""we cant provide it in writing -- we wrote your name down and have you on record"" line. Guess what -- I called back a couple months later and they had no record. They refused to honor the credit....and were rude. I asked to speak to the owner, and was told ""hes out of town."" The pizza is mediocre at best. I have zero tolerance for businesses such as this. PLEASE spend your money somewhere else that deserves to be patronized."

Also, they have a great breakfast. Omelet station and all. I suggest the chorizo and egg burritos. GREAT outside patio"

The restaurant is super clean and the wait staff is very friendly. And the food, WOW!  We split the Shrimp Ceviche and the combination pupusa plate. The portions were very generous. I ordered the fruit drink. Everything was absolutely delicious. One of my new favorite restaurants . Will definitely be back."

2,"The ""Protein Pancakes"" are always a treat, but the ""California Eggs Benedict"" was just awful today.  The biggest disappointment were the hash browns though.  They tasted like shredded cardboard.  I am tired of going to a restaurant 20 to 30 times and getting such inconsistent results. Shame on you US Egg!"

4,"If you need any office supplies, furniture, printers, computers, or one of them fancy electronic book readers, then you should check this place out. Not being a teacher or office manager/employee, I only come to these stores for printer ink. I was greeted with a friendly ""Hello, can I help you find something"" by one of the employees. My friend was looking for a stapler which the employee quickly guided us down the aisle to find an extensive collection, although I didnt see a red Swingline stapler ;)   There is a huge print service station in the back and plenty of employees to help out with anything. Check out was super quick as there were three cashiers open and ready for a customer. Oh and I found out, thanks to my teacher friend, that you get a discount if you are a teacher. Pretty rad."

Just a nice quaint place to sit outside and have a good lunch. One problem I have with Zinc Bistro is that they have Stella on tap, great right? But for $7! Thats one for $7. Come on, maybe $4. I just bought 12 for $10 at Total Wine."

The sweetness from the crumbled amaretti is a very nice touch. I ordered the Healthy Fish again (see pics) and once again it was perfect! My guest ordered the Penne Salsiccia (see pics) which had Italian sausage, caramelized onions and pecorino cheese! The sausage was really good and for just $5 you cant beat that!"

1,"When I was growing up we called this the canal. In other parts of town it is still called the canal. In some places people actually fish from it. I think they die right after they eat their catch, which is why you dont see them very often. Over the years you periodically hear about dead bodies being found in the canal as well.  Google it. What is so annoying about this is that Scottsdale, is trying to make it seem like this isnt the same heinous canal thats always been there. When I heard about the development around the Scottsdale Waterfront, I couldnt figure out what they were talking about. What water? Then I started cracking up when I found out it was the canal. Come on Scottsdale, you can put a dress and lipstick on a pig, but it is still a pig. You are not fooling anyone."
2,"Whats up with the premium gas in this state being only 91 grade?  Wheres the 93?  Anyhoo, this is a very busy gas station at the corner of 16th and Highland. When the pumps are full of cars, its hard to maneuver in and around the parking lot. The store looks a bit short on supplies, but then again I just went inside to pay.  I may give it another try, well see.  But Ill look elsewhere first."

I ate an onion, tasted like the grill.  I are a pepper, tasted like the grill.  I ate the cheese, tasted like a burnt grill with cheese on top.  YUCK!  I ate about 4 forks full and was so disgusted I had to chuck it. Fail of an airport dinner to the max!"
3,"Great authentic Greek food; excellent service.  We ordered a combination appetizer plate (hummus, dolmas, pitas, olives, spanikopita, etc).  It was a nice variety and filling for two.  The flaming cheese is festive.  The desert was a flaming custard that was just ok, but the ice cream and carmel made it better than average (plus the flaming part is always fun).  Only thing missing was breaking plates.  Id definately go back if craving greek."

I made the mistake of going yesterday in the middle of the day (111 degrees out, yikes!)

In the last two years the boyfriend and I have eaten at this restaurant location quite often. For the money, you get exactly what you pay for: a decent meal and generous portions. The chips and salsa are ever-flowing and the salsa is some of the best Ive tasted. The wait staff are generally pleasant, attentive and very accommodating. Plus they frequently recall what you had during your previous visits. I recommend you try the Machaca dinner or my boyfriends favorite dish, the number 5 lunch special. There are multiple locations in the valley, but this one beats them all hands down."

1,"Tried a couple Tammie Coe cupcakes and a mini muffin two weeks ago... Unfortunately for them, I also sampled Ollie Cakes... No wonder Ollie Cakes, aka Urban Cookie, won Cupcake Wars and Tammie Coe sits in high rent selling pretty sugar disguised as a cupcake. Drive a few miles north, get whatever the special cupcake of the day is along with a Brown Velvet and Lemon, and save saying you enjoyed Tammie Coe for impressing snooty folk who wouldnt know yummy if it bit them on the butt! Really, the TC cakes were just cakes... No flavor, no texture, dry... And I cant say how impressed I was that the clerk shoved all my selections into one, tiny, flat bag meant for cookies or sandwiches!  Apparently presentation and flavor preservation mean nothing... As their products now do, at least to me."
3,"Went here for fathers day with my girlfriends parents because they gave a free entree for dad. He choose the fish and chips which looked amazing, I had fish tacos, my girlfirend had the steak and her mom got a salad. Everyhting was good. The service was great and the beers were decent. It was everything I could expect from a chain and thensome. I might even go back."

The guy behind the counter was helpful as soon as I walked in, and showed me exactly what I needed. They know what they sell very well, and can give excellent recommendations on whatever you might be looking for. It was great to talk shop with someone who obviously knew his stuff."

4,A very unique restaurant in the old town section of Scottsdale.  Very interesting menu and unbelievably the largest wine list I have ever encountered.  A nice combination.   Ordered several of the small dishes.  All were cooked to perfection. and tasted very good.  Especially liked the chopped salad  and scallops were especially good.  Nice setting.  Friendly greeter and server.   The atmosphere is very casual with a touch of elegance.  Recommended for sure.

3,"We were visiting again, so of course that means at least 2 trips to Sugar Bowl!  The food, service and ice cream were good as always, but WOW, the prices sure have gone up.  I know that the economy sucks, but for what we got, the prices just dont seem to justify it.  We had different waitresses both times.  The fist was efficient but not very warm.  We had Sandra on our second visit - and YES, she remembered us again!  Could not believe it.  She is very friendly and can really keep up when they get swamped.  We will be back, but maybe only once per visit instead of 2 (or 3 or 4) times.  Just cant afford those prices for what you get."

However, this place, despite its pseudo-hipness fails to deliver in the cocktail department, which, with its continuously crappy music, would be the only real reason youd come to this bar. Its really a 2.5 star place-- bartenders are nice,but dont really get the job done. When youre paying over $8/drink, youd at least expect them to do that. The roof is cool though so an extra .5 stars for that."

Except for the grilled fish tacos. Thus 2 stars. Not 1. When I lived at DCRanch, I thought this would be a less expensive, less formal place to hang out.

They couldnt even figure out HOW to fix my car, even when I TOLD them what was wrong with it ( had been diagnosed at the Dealership). Two guys were sitting there staring at the computer (as if it was going to magically speak to them). At least they didnt charge me, but what a waste of time waiting for 90 minutes...."

They have plenty of syrups to flavor your drinks, if thats what youre into. I like the atmosphere in there, and the bike wheel ""art"" is pretty interesting and unique. This place is probably really great to study in, considering the fact that I see a sea of macbook apples every time I walk in here.  The employees are funny and nice. Anyway, it is definitely worth checking out."

The guy was not friendly and just wanted our money even though he did not do his job! I would NEVER recommend this company to anyone. We paid $1000 and got $20 worth of service. I mopped the floor the day after the cleaning guy was here and got a lot of the ""staining as he would say"" off easily. I have included a picture that we wrote in the floor with a paper towel after the cleaning....can you read the saying? That is exctaly how we felt after the service. REALLY?!?!?"

The food was literally inedible, everything was either too cold or burnt to a char, nothing tasted good. We decided to try the desert and the cream puff (Im unsure how you can mess that up) was petrified and the cream was so gross I spit it out. The smell of the flan actually made us gag, we had such an awful time I complained to the manager. She didnt even seem to care, and gave us 20% off of a lunch we didnt even eat. We were disgusted by this place, and we will never, ever go back. Dont do it, you will regret it!"

4,"Ordered the King Carlos IV.  It was HUGE, two of us ate half of it.  I thought it would be smaller than that.  It had all the major meats plus hotdogs, cheeses, and a siracha type sauce.  I think this was featured in diners, drive-ins, and dives.  It was very good but just wow huge.  It came with a side of ruffled chips.  Very nice people.  The fruit smoothies were good the horchata decent but not the best Ive had.  Great bang for your buck though.  Id go again and try something a bit more sensibly sized. There was a wait of about 15 minutes or so.  Very popular on a Saturday for lunch :)"

I LOVE the fact that each dish is mildly spiced, and left up to the individual to customize the flavor depending on which sauces they choose.  Im a spicy lightweight so it was great that I didnt have to worry about getting something too hot to enjoy. I had a bowl of brown rice, cumin potatoes and tofu masala with a cool yogurt-cucumber-mint sauce on the side.  It was fantastic!  I cant wait to go back. ...also, I thought it was adorable that we were given a golden dollar coin with our check for ""making the drive to their location and to compensate for high-gas prices"".  A memorable gesture!"

3,"Zoes gets a solid 3 stars b/c they have the raddest, most sinfully delightful chocolate cake around. The best part is its only $2.00!  The reasonably sized slice of cake totally makes up for the boring, albeit sometimes satisfying food.  The chx kabobs are pretty awesome, enough for two people.  Comes with two huge scewers of chx, peppers, cherry tomatoes... over a bed of salad and rice pilaf.  Pretty delish.  The Gruben Sandwich is also a hit.  FYI -- If you dont like Feta, stay away from this place.  They put it on just about everything.  They trully believe in that old addage, ""Feta makes it Betta!"""

The food has such a horrible after taste.  I not only hated my meal but tried my boyfriends as well and it was still terrible.  The service compares to the food, we waited forvever just for a server to come over and greet us.  I wouldnt even recommend this place to my enemies."

5,Yen has amazing sushi. I would say that they have the best sushi in AZ. You have to try it to see how amazing it is. The service is great and I feel like I just stepped into Japan. The whole sushi experience is very authentic and perfect place to hang out with friends or take a date :D There is only one thing I dont like. Sometimes it gets to busy so make sure to get there early (around 7 P.M) if you want to be seated right away.

I know I know, its a chain... and maybe I just have high expectations, being that Im from back east where we have small family-run Greek restaurants on every corner."

I really can appreciate the fact that these are wholesome, well-made toys with a focus on learning rather than supporting the corporate brands and Hollywood characters.  But it is just not practical for your everyday shopping needs.  I recommend it when you want a special or unusual gift or if you have one of those rare children that wants intellectual stimulation more than to impress their friends with the latest electronic gadget or action figure."

Winters are a bit chilly after sunset, and the summer... well I dont need to explain that one.  No great deals on food or drinks. Service is hit or miss but I come for the company and dont really mind. Order a few pitchers and your grub to cook, then pretend youre at home having a BBQ. No service required!"

1,This place has the oiliest food Ive ever eaten in my life.  I had carry out one evening (two dishes) and the entrees were soaked in oil.  I had to rinse with water my eggplant dish three times just to eat it without feeling sick to my stomach.  I wish I couldve washed the other dish too (but it wasnt one that could be washed--it was a wide-rice noodle dish). Can definitely taste the MSG in these dishes too. Really not sure what the fuss is about.

Also Shepard pie we ordered had extra ingredients such as zuccini, so they should have warned us about not being a proper Shepard pie.  Gordon Ramsay would have been mad.  Service was good. Only saving grace."

5,So my friend and I stumbled upon this place on our way to Barbs bakery but WOW I have never had a better taco in my life. The carne asada street tacos are freaking amazing. They also have the bottled cokes from mexico that for some reason taste sweeter than cokes bottled here. The waitress was also extremely friendly when we were checking out we asked how to pronounce the name of the restaurant and she started teaching us some Spanish.

2,"Drinking + Arcade Games. This should be an obvious winner, right? Wrong. Oh, how wrong.  Eating here is like eating in a casino, only less classy and with worse food.  Beers are overpriced but absolutely necessary to make it through the event.  Those combo deals that include beers and a game card seem like a good idea, until its 45 minutes later, youre out of points, youre nowhere near drunk and youve already spent $40. If you go late, try not to get syphilis when you walk by San Felipes."

3,"Ive decided to up the rating of this place to 3 stars because I went back for a second try. (it was close to work)  This time the burger actually had juices left.  They still wont cook it less then well done which puts me off but at least it had flavor this time. I still dont recommend this place when you can spend a bit more and get a real burger at FEZ, Zinburger or Delux."

For the price tag it should at least come with a small bag of chips. Honestly the chips were so average it was disappointing. the salsa that comes with it was mediocre considering the hold out factor applied.   The salsa that came with my  tacos was exceptional, that should be their signature salsa for everything. Sodas by the can, no refills,,geezzz,, another 3.00 bucks later. I think I ended up spending over $12 for 3 small tacos and small basket of chips, and 2 sodas in z can.  For that price,  I want more atmosphere or at least a 4 bite taco."

The regular margaritas are fine and priced okay at $8, but to charge $15 without warning is usury. The service was okay, not great. The menu is also hard to read because the type and busy background design. I would have given 4 stars if the margaritas were $11, but $15?? This is not Modern Steak or the W !!"

During our visit, we took a tour given by a Navajo student.  He was very knowledgeable and definitely kept everyones attention with the information that he provided.  With the amount of exhibits on display in this museum, you can easily spend two or three hours just taking in everything that is offered.  There is a wide range of items on display from dolls to paintings to glass work to clothing and jewelry.  Another cool thing is that this museum allows you to photograph anything that you want."

2,"Absolutely, positively bitter. They use a powder in lieu of syrups which adds a after taste I dont care for. There was no color difference between my beverage (latte) and my friends (iced coffee). Why... I have no clue. We order these drinks everywhere and this has never happened before. I can see how a powder would be more cost effective but the taste was something I did not care for. Maybe that makes me a coffee snob, I am not sure."

2,"Best beer selection in Arizona but the good features end there.  Its the only reason I return and put up with the following.  Service is often horrible, even during the day when there are few patrons.  Often you have to go up to the bar to order even when there is a server in your section.  It makes no sense that a mug of beer should be empty for more than 10 minutes before it is noticed. Food is subpar and wouldnt get such a pass from most people if this place didnt have the beer.  Prices are reasonable.  Website is often inaccurate re: what is actually on tap."

Sorry to be blunt but thats all it is. $18 dishes that are $8 at a real Thai restaurant. The spring rolls were very bland and came with only a tiny bit of sauce for dipping. They should also include on the table a selection of fish sauces and spices to add to your meals and appetizers. They dont have. If you like spicy, skip it for sure. Again this is what we would call Tourist Thai back in Thailand.  Tiny servings. The good. Friendly wait staff. If authentic Thai is what youre looking for try any of these: Palees Crown, Tum Nak Thai or Royal Thai Grill."

Well this time Thunder Dan didnt hit this buzzer beater. First off it does get two stars for a reason so lets start there. The atmosphere is great. The venue is super cool and there is tons of tvs.  Thats pretty much where it stops. The food isnt great and is relatively slow. I have had a burger, wings, the chicken quesadilla and a couple of other things which didnt impress me. Plus the service was super slow... This kind of reminds me of the Suns-Bulls series super exciting but just misses the mark of greatness. I am sticking with my old faithful two blocks away Zipps."

We were never brought out the fries or beans and rice- reason for it per the server- there was a big party (8ppl) slowing the kitchen up. Food was good, not great, staff was very nice and hospitable. I will go back to give this place another shot- try something different on the menu as the waffles were super heavy and doughy.

I have never cared for the place....so I definitely wont miss it. However if your looking for some decent electronic gear at 60-80% off....then this is your weekend to go. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends"

1,"Tried to eat here Friday night for the seafood buffet. We waited in line for 90 minutes before finally giving up. Would have been much sooner but the drive down there from my house is almost an hour.  They have three lines, tiered based on the level of players club card. The diamond card holders waltzed right in and the hostesses would seat from that line until it was empty before anyone from the lesser lines would be seated. At the end, we stood still... didnt move an inch... for 20 minutes. So no-one from our line was seated for 20 minutes while dozens of people waltzed right through in the diamond and platinum lines.  What a fucking joke. Waster my whole evening trekking down there dreaming of crab legs just to be snubbed by them. Never, EVER again."

1,"I decided to break from routine and get a haircut at a local Great Clips. I called ahead and asked if they had an experienced barber that could do a flat top. The lady assured me that they did. I was Leary to say the least when she sat me in a chair of a 20 something fibbertygibbet dressed like Madonna. Half way through this butchering, she asked my advice and then the advice of the owner on how to accomplish this haircut. Kid you not, it was an inch longer at the sides than the center. I looked like a cross between the Gunny and flock of seagulls. I went home, set the clippers on 3 and finished the job......Would not go back here unless I lost a bet."

2,"This is a top sushi joint?  Really?  I had kinda forgotten what less than medicocre sushi tastes like.  Most conveyor belt places serve more flavorful sushi. First of all, whats with the mayo on everything?  Rule of thumb: if it has mayonnaise or tomatoes, or if its cooked and lacks an exotic name like ankimo, its probably not real sushi.  My tekkamaki had a funny color and sour taste to it and for goodness sake, why cant they call it tekkamaki?.  The scallop sushi was not very sweet.  The softshell crab roll was greasy and without texture, not to mention the white mayo-laden crab salad that accompanied it...shudder!  This place averages 4+ stars on Yelp.  Youre kidding, right?  You people must not get our that much.  Whats the criteria for a 3?  It stays in your stomach?"

3,"I have never been into soul food per se, but my husband woke up craving some chicken and waffles, and well, you can guess where we ended up. We were so pumped that there was Kool Aid on the menu, so we ordered that immediately. I dont know why every restaurant doesnt do this... Kool Aid is amazing. The service was decent - our waitress was quite friendly, and the food came out quick. I got biscuits and gravy, which was pretty delish. The gravy was thick and filling. So filling, in fact, that I couldnt finish them. I also got a side of mac and cheese which was not great, and I didnt eat a lot of it. Overall, Id give this place a solid 3. Id come back again, but mostly because my husband thought it was some kind of wonderful."

2,"I heard nothing but praise about the food and atmosphere of this chain restaurant.  I loved the look of this place inside and out. Great rustic barrels and old barber chairs in the bar area gave a unique look. Service was friendly and fast.  Food was less than desirable. Salad was nothing but iceberg lettuce (and I got a stump) with some shredded red cabbage. My pasta dish was spaghetti with a white clam sauce. It was too salty and there was a sprinkling of microscopic clam bits.  I always take leftovers home, this time I didnt. While the prices are good its not worth a less than average meal. Husband was equally disappointed with his chicken marsala. Chances of going back are slim to none."

2,Good service. The waitress was friendly. but the food was just icky and the Place smelled bad! like sewage pipes. I had a glass of wine. there was no way I was going to order a mixed drink while she was tearing the bar down.  I didnt feel good after eating the food. I had a coupon so it made the total bill cheap. But i would have walked out if I had to pay full price because The atmosphere they boast should provide better food. No Not good dont go

5,Pure Bliss - I havent had a quality meal experience like this in a very very long time.   The full 4 course dinner was stupendous and well worth every cent.  You MUST try the Yin & Yang Martini!  It was  a very creative and well presented drink  that had me all smiles.   I had the Smores & Chocolate desert and it was hands down my favorite (Ive tried at least 5 others).

1,"The organization is grand with a ton of selection but the employees could care less about costumer service.  It is very amazing with the amount of unemployed people in the city they have to hire the most incompetent individuals....  Im not going to be ignorant and say they are ALL bad, but a few in the bunch seem to make it difficult to be a repeat costumer.  Try talking to a manager at this location and you will be routed around the store till you finally get some one that states ""the manager is off till next week.""  i will stay a website purchaser until they change their policy at this location and hire individuals with a better standard"

2,"I got the banana nutella cupcake and love the banana bread-like cupcake. However, the frosting is way too sweet and overpowers the banana flavor of the cupcake. As many reviewers have already mentioned, the cupcake is also over-priced at $3.75 each for the size and the lack of creativity.  With so many desert/snack places in Scottsdale, I am unlikely to come back here."

Is it the best breakfast option you could possibly encounter, well no.  Its just every once in awhile I find I just want Waffle House. ( Fond late night memories from college I would guess. )  It can be for breakfast, lunch, dinner, whenever. So what does this location have going for it that makes it better than the average Waffle House? 1. Lots of parking 2. Its not in a shady part of town 3. It has a really nice staff  4. They are fairly speedy 5. The restaurant is clean So there you go if you have a craving for waffles and hash browns then this is one of the better WH in the area."

Well, I didnt read the fine print and it was only for the last Thursday of every month.  Not a problem - the owner/manager was great when I told him I had kind of skimmed over the fine print, and he still honored the group on.  We had delicious tacos, yummy margaritas and left thinking how great people in AZ are :)"

2,"I had high hopes for this restaurant, but to be honest, it let me down.  The wild mushroom and goat cheese salad was phenomenal.  From there it was downhill.  Great ambiance, though I think they are trying too hard to be a steakhouse.   Most importantly though...  Given it is a seafood restaurant, they sure didnt know how to cook my fish.  It was fried and oily (and was not marketed that way on the menu!)  I wanted something light and left feeling like I ate a ton of bricks.  My friends scallops - she said they were ""okay"" and not better than that. Oh, and the prices are set as if it were a steakhouse too. (Note: if it were, which its not.) Mediocre at best."

We saw her once more, when she took our food order, after which she sat in the corner and ate. The remaining staff dropped off our food without a word, and never came back; in fact, I had to flag down the manager to get cashed out. The food was sub par. My wifes Shepard pie was all mashed potatoes, and my chicken strips were incorrect and with the wrong side. Also, my fries were soggy because they had been placed over excess sauce.  Poor food, awful service, overpriced beer. Visit the Kyrene location or dont go at all."

2,Service here is unfriendly at best ( i sat in the bar)menu both lunch and regular boring .chips ok salsa served in a small caraf which makes it inconvienent  to get salsa to chip. food was ok some of the chicken in my taco was dry do to the 8 million degree oven they put it in before serving to you . this place is a true tourist/youngen scottsdale hipsters joint

1,Was I there on a bad day or what?  I showed up 15 minutes after they opened and EVERY item I tried was either luke warm or cold.    They have 15+ items on the lunch buffet and I tried a bite of all of them.   Gross and bland.   I felt sick to my stomach after I left because I kept thinking how bad the food was. Yuck!

2,"just wanted to chime in & say that this place is so vegetarian-UN-friendly its not even funny. I was dragged here with family & ended up ordering a chile relleno, which was just about the only meatless item on the menu, short of a fucking cheese crisp. it wasnt terrible, but this place is really just all kinds of lame. service was mediocre, food was mediocre. with as many awesome & authentic mexican restaurants as there are in the valley, theres no reason on earth to come back, except MAYBE to try a mango margarita."

1,"If I could give zero stars, I would. Just about the worst experience for my friend and I. We came in for a quick and easy dinner.  After being ignored at the door way repeatedly, we sat ourselves.  First, we had a girl server who said shed be back with menus, but right in front of us at the bar we see her flirting instead of coming back. Our server switched to another guy who was just as bad at serving. I have no idea how this place ever received more than one star based on the staff alone. Theyre lazy, slow, and completely ruin the entire experience of dining there.  The happy hour prices are great, but there are other RAs so do yourself a favor and go to a different location."

Youd never know that theres a bar inside when you get to the parking lot behind the Ice Rink - just look for the signs on the top of the building.  They have lots of TVs for hockey fans and the bar looks right out onto the ice so you can watch people skate. They had a great jukebox and the Rockband kit so you can rock out with all your newest bar friends.  For food selection you have BBQ, BBQ, or BBQ...either beef, pork, or chicken, with a side for $6.50. Tasty stuff! Great beer selection including Molson Canadian or Labatt Blue."

3,"I like the Thai Hut because it is safe Thai eating. They have some of the more adventurous authentic Thai, and then they have what I ALWAYS get - The Garden Delight with beef. Just basically vegetables and beef cooked in a marinade. They always have plenty of servers on hand and Ive never been disappointed. Theres just some little sparkle that it seems to be missing. I struggled between giving it a 3 or a 4, but I settled on a 3 because they could definitely improve the atmosphere a little bit and parking sucks. They are really close to the light rail now though, just get off at McDowell/Central and walk one block east on McDowell."

The bar and drinks are great and the food is fantastic. Like i said, Im from California and live in the Bay Area, so I thought I knew what great seafood was - wrong! Who knew that the desert had better (well almost better) seafood than San Francisco or Monterey Bay?   I had the Vanilla Battered Sole with Gorgonzola Mac & Cheese - Amazing! Never tasted anything like that - I recommend that this place be the first stop to anybody looking for a fun night out."

3,"Mucho Taco falls closer to 2.5 stars-average.  The prices are very good and the staff was very friendly. Let me start with some positives:  the salsa was fresh and tasty as in these were whole tomatoes 5 minutes ago.  veggies on the tacos were also fresh and crisp. I had a fish taco & a carnitas taco-total about $4.50.  The fish was decent but the carnitas was pretty gristly.  I overheard the kitchen staff talking to a customer and found out that they make liberal use of the ""L"" word here.  Thats right, old school cookin for better or worse; Lard."

4,"There are bunch of different tours. I went on the hour long one (probably the cheapest one as well) where I didnt see the bedrooms or inside of the house. It was very hot coming here on a summer day - I do NOT recommend it. They do provide you with water and a red umbrella though.  I learned a lot about architecture from the tour and why certain things were done. I would recommend coming here during the fall seasons because they mentioned you can see the tents out there.  So quick summary - basically, Frank Lloyd Wright would live at this place during the winter months when it was warm in Arizona but super cold where hes from. He didnt come here during the summer months - way too hot!"

A different food-deliverer brought out food and ""auctioned it off"" (didnt know who got what), and I asked for a refill on my empty water glass, but he didnt bring it after 15 minutes, and Nicole didnt notice, so I had to bring it up to her. Their bloody Marys taste just like tomato juice with tobasco.  Nothing special at all.  And for $12???!?!?!??!?!  SHAME. The coq au vin was great. WHY IS THERE NO ""CONTACT US""/e-mail address ON THEIR WEBSITE?????"

It was mostly sour mix. An it was awful (How do you mess up a margarita?(2nd clue to leave) Server is surprised we wanted to order dinner! (3rd clue to run!) Very disappointing.

2,This Baja Fresh really didnt impress me.  Its pricey considering that all youre getting is meat in a tortilla.  It doesnt have that Mexican feel to it and is unoriginal.  There were bugs on the wall.  The food is good however.  Nothing special though.  Since its a corporate chain you cant expect sizzling flavor but I was left unsatisfied.  There are better Mexican food places to go to.

5,"This is the most progressive, inclusive, welcoming, diverse, intellectually stimulating, public-service oriented church in the Valley, if not the West Coast.  Weve been to more than a few and can attest to that.   Pastor Jeff not only knows everyones name but is genuinely concerned about everything that goes on in your life.  The congregation is like one big family.  Love for your neighbors is not just a commandment at this church - its acted upon.

Its a nice bowling alley and I can imagine spending a few hours here like I did tonight with my Phoenix Fabulous Forty Womens Club.  The bar is very nice for a bowling alley. They even have a pool table!  They serve decent food and cold drinks to your lanes with waiter service.  All the lanes, screens and scoring boards are new, clean and state of the art. Theres no old smelly gross carpet to be avoided either, which is classic of bowling alleys I have been in!  Prices for rental equipment and lane use is average cost.  I had a great time and will definitely return to enjoy the faculties again and again.  Oh and the staff were so nice and professional also!"

The magic, was gone.  I was so disappointed and sad that it wasnt as memorable as I previously remember.  I will go back and try something else because I didnt have a bad experience and never have. I recently sat at the bar and had 2 different bartenders.  Both were great and entertaining.  And, it doesnt help that they poured a strong and delicious drink.  Get a martini!!"

2,"I read the two good reviews here on Yelp, so I was looking forward to a good Italian dinner.  Unfortunately, it must have been an off night.  The waitress didnt want to be bothered and the meatballs and the tomato sauce on the spaghetti didnt have much flavor.  Thats the test of a good Italian restaurant for me.  If the sauce is good, they usually get thumbs up.  This sauce wasnt ""bad,"" but it was bland and watery.  Even the bowl of spaghetti wasnt drained properly so there was a dripping, runny mess at the bottom of the paltry bowl of pasta.  This place is right around the corner from my house and Dominic is my brothers name!  So I was really disappointed."

4,"Upper Crust is like Grimaldis on steroids. The two places have nearly identical decor and the pizza is extremely similar. Upper Crust uses a little more cheese which is nice, but they also use cornmeal on the crust which I am not crazy about. The wings are huge and delicious, especially with the honey BBQ sauce. The meatballs are nothing special (with or without the mozzarella cheese), but Stephanie H would disagree. Happy hour is Monday-Friday 4pm to 7pm and on Wednesdays they offer half off on bottles of wine.  Overall, it is a very good pizza and I plan on returning. Next time Ill be giving that pizza cookie a try. I really liked Upper Crust, but Grimaldis in Old Town is still my favorite for traditional NY style thin crust pizza."

2,"I judge a soul food place by its fried chicken, a donut shop by its old fashioned, an ice cream place by its vanilla, and a Greek place by its gyros.  The gyros here are bland and wholly unspectacular - and sourced from the same frozen food purveyor (Sysco?) as every other gyro stop in Phoenix.  The cloyingly thick pita didnt help either. I dont know why it is so challenging to find a legitimate rotating spit gyro in this town - but it is.  Especially near downtown Phoenix. Recommendations welcome."

Thanks to Lindsey and Yelp, I had the opportunity to go and the performance was just stunning. When I walked in, I noticed the lobby was beautifully decorated, a gentleman reading a story to children and a ballet dancer posing for pictures. The bartenders we bought our drinks from, was very friendly and accomodating.  I cant say enough about how beautiful the performance was from the dancers, the sets, the costumes, etc. Just incredible. I may just take my daughter to see it with me this season...."

2,"In a word -- Blah.  Its a chain so I didnt expect much, and in this case my expectations were correct. I ordered the shrimp tacos were alright, but nothing to write home about.  My take is that the food is mediocre and overpriced.  Plus the service was sub-par; we waited over 15 minutes to get our drinks refilled and when we asked for separate checks the server grumbled about it.  Believe me, there is better, cheaper, and more authentic Mexican food in Arizona."

4,"I usually hate chains, especially Italian ones like Olive Garden and Romanos. But I was pleasantly surprised my Maggianos. We went because we got a gift card for Christmas but we are probably going back.  The bread and the dipping oil they start you out with is pretty good. I wish the dipping oil was just a little more seasoned though. My husband ordered the linguine and clams which he said was just ok. My stepson had the crab and shrimp cannelloni which he enjoyed. I really liked my eggplant Parmesan. It is the best egg parm I have had at a chain. The sauce is fresh tasting which huge chunks of garlic. One nice surprise is that our server said that my dish qualified for a free take home dish of the same category. So I ordered the gnocchi and had a nice dinner the next day."

5,"When I was a dancer I always came here for everything. Shoes, leotards, skirts, and accessories. They have every type of dance shoe and a wide variety of everything dancers need and want.  Im not sure how many dance shops are in the area, but all of my instructors always recommended this place which is not very close to our studio. The staff is all very kind and knowledgeable which trust me is a very good thing. Dance shoes can get confusing! There are at least three different kind of tap shoes!  Dees also has costume rentals so if you ever need a crazy costume at the last minute Dees can help you out with that too!"

It felt to me like this hotel was trying to be a hotel that you would find in vegas.  the rooms are overpriced, there is no storage in them and they give you like 5 hangers total.  The water here is awful so dont drink it.  The pool area is nice, and the room service is very quick.  So those aspects of this hotel are nice.  I am not sure i would spend 300 buks to stay here though again.  I am not really into the party scene but if you are this might be your kind of place.  Id rather be at a pub bar or sports bar personally but to each their own!"

3,Met some friends here for happy hour the other day.  This is the old El Paso BBQ and they did a knockout job with the remodel. Great feel and warm colors to the place now. I had a couple of Coronas and some chips and guacamole.  The regular menu looks better than the happy hour menu and think Ill try them the next time for lunch or dinner.

2,"Uhhh...These are supposed to be carne fries?  ASU boys think that these are the best carne fries. Me thinks not. The carne fries consist of boiled meat AND the order is wrong. Its supposed to have the guacamole on top of the sour cream on top of the melted cheese over the meat, but they just dumped the boiled carne asada on top of the sour cream. I told some ASU boy about this, but he said that I probably had a different person making my carne fries  the wrong way. What a disappointment, but I ate everything anyway because Im fat like that. hahha"

1,"Wow! I cant believe this place gets so many good reviews.  I was hauled here once by co-workers looking for a cheap meal. But, how much value does your lunch dollar have when you dont even want to eat the food? Dry and sticky rice; ""white meat chicken"" unidientifiable as such, and a sweet glaze that provided the only flavor. Quite frankly, it was disgusting, and none of the dishes my co-workers had looked any better (though they seemed to be fine with them). I should know to stay away from restaurants that have pictures of their menu items on the wall. The one star is only for the fast and friendly service."

5,"Thanks to Yelp I was able to find this hidden jewel.  The place looks like a spanish style motel converted into a restaurant.  With a cute garden in the back.  I had already eaten so didnt intend on a 2nd breakfast.  But stingy GF only allowed me a few bites so I had to ask Chris to whip up  another plate for me.   It was my first time having chilled salmon done that way and it was so good.  Everything tasted so fresh.   For the price you get to drink all you want.  And I must have had at least 10 glasses of the orange juice with mixed berries.   The food and the atmosphere reminds me of eating in Napa, CA.   Will definitely return when Im in town."

4,"The Original Burrito Co. is quickly becoming my favorite burrito place. The owner came to eat at the restaurant I work at and she told me to come by and try this place out and being a huge fan of Mexican food I had to go. The burritos are really huge and really well priced. I love the California burrito with Chicken, add guacamole. The chicken is so moist and tender. I have tried the carne asada as well, but when I got it it was full of cilantro and jalapenos, which were just overbearing, but Im thinking it could have been a bad day and will have to try it again. Downside for me would be that the salsa is not spicy at all. It tastes very good, but I am a huge fan of spicy, especially on Mexican food, and its a bummer for me when a place does not offer a very spicy salsa."

I cant understand why someone would work a job they hate. The food though, is incredibly tasty, and has plenty of options for vegitarians and carnivores. I like the hipster atmosphere and the food a ton. The drinks are weak, and overpriced, but the food reasonable. This translates over to next door where they charge 9 bucks for a well drink. They also treat you like scum. Im only giving this restaurant a 4 because I pay a lot more attention to food quality and taste than I do service. I also love the fact they are open late. I work til 10pm most nights so its good to have an option that isnt fast food."

I frequently stop in early in the mornings for coffee and a muffin (I live in the area).  The muffins are EXCELLENT, unique and tasty . . when they are available.  It doesnt seem like the pastry chef begins early enough in the morning to have pastries ready to go around 6:30 or 7am.

We had three donuts - glazed, chocolate long john, and a coffee old fashioned/sour cream.  The last was a bit stale.  The first two were peachy.  We will go back.  Nice little place and its open 24 hours."
5,"This review is for locals...the Hyatt isnt just a beautiful spot to stay it, its also a perfect spot to just sit and enjoy the day! Ive done this several times, many times for dinner and drinks afterward on the patio. Most recently, I decided to set up shop and do some work from one of the comfy chairs on the outdoor patio which allowed me to enjoy the gorgeous Arizona weather and still get some work done. They do an excellent job of making the hotel amenities comfortable and welcoming.  For hotel guests, if you are planning to stay here, be sure to look into staying in one of the rooms that sit on the man made lake. They have great patios right on the water so when you wake up, you could have breakfast on the lake! It doesnt get much better than that."

1,"I used to go here at least 3 times a week for Happy hour.  The volcano chicken was my favorite meal.  However, the last time I was in there I had a cricket in my water.  I took a sip squeezed the lemon, and thought there was something wrong with the taste.  I checked and at first thought it was a lemon seed but no, sure enough it was a cricket (in which i took a picture).  The way this restaurant handled an insect in my water was repulsive.  One of the male bartenders came over and brought a new water saying, ""It happens.""  No, sorry thats disgusting.  If i hadnt been craving the volcano chicken I went there for I would have just left.  And then on top of getting a cricket in my water theres no discount or compensation off of my bill."

And the Phoenix downtown area is pretty boring and sparse except for the baseball stadium right next to it with some cool bars and restaurants. When there isnt a game, this area seems pretty dead. Bottom line: Ho hum. Baseball stadium nearby is great entertainment option but can be a pain with all the traffic if you are trying to get out of the convention center area in the evening."

It was cooked just right and it was rested correctly.  Needless to say, I was so stuffed that my 10 minute walk became a 15 walk back to the hotel."

3,"Its three stars because I dont know how to rate it -- I didnt think it was very good at all when I went the other night during their grand opening, but maybe I just dont have a taste for it.  Service was prompt and polite.  The food?  Eh.  I had one of the house specials.  I didnt think it was very special.  I do think the waiter deserves bonus points for talking me into a half order rather than a full order.  The lemon-lime beverage was strong and sweet."

They just moved to a great place up the street (where Verde used to be for locals) with more room so now everything isnt so crammed! Not that we all didnt enjoy their original house, this one just says, ""Im still awesome, I just stepped up a notch."" Everything is delicious. I love their 5 Spot, the waffles are great, and their lunch specials are always amazing. If you like jelly - try their homemade stuff. Try the bacon."

I have only had my oil changed for the last year here and they are trying to put it off on someone else, when no one else has clearly done our oil. The insurance for walmart wont even look at my vehicle and had already decided they are not at fault. I had a 3rd party appraiser look at it and they can only determine it was from an oil change. I have no other option but to take this to a lawyer."

1,"Surprised this place isnt closed by now. Went here once when I first started going to ASU and never came back. Their ingredients are not fresh, gyro meat tastes old and decrepit. They really need to hire better pita makers who dont resemble drug addicts and derelicts. My pita was falling apart before it was even handed to me. Literally, by the time I got it to the table it was soggy and not even worth eating!"

Since I cant, I decided to balance out another reviewer who gave the place 4 stars but also thought it deserved 3 1/2. Positive notes:  Hot sauce had some bite to it, chips were good, Camarones culichi had a wonderful sauce.  Lots of fresh limes served with the meal.  Full bar. Not-so-positive notes:  Shrimp in the Camarones culichi was overcooked (cardinal sin for a seafood place).  The shrimp coctail was just ok - good sized boiled shrimp, but not too much flavor.   If driving by and hungry I would stop in again, but not if I have to drive too far out of the way."

I dont understand why I have to be carded at the door, carded at the table, then carded at the bar. There were 3 groups in the entire place, and we still got slow and crappy service.  I wish I had better things to say. But really.... the experience completely sours the good things about this place."

1,"Cummings took over the company that we originally used, and since they have taken over we have had nothing but problems. I havent seen a single bug in years in my house and as soon as we started using Cummings weve found a bug almost every single day and not just bugs but cockroaches. I called Cummings to ask them about why this was happening and the receptionist was extremely rude saying they didnt do anything wrong. I would NEVER recommend this company to anyone.  Needless to say I will be finding a new pest control company today."

4,"This place has been around forever. I started coming here when I was 5 or 6, especially when my grandpa came to town from Cincinnati. He loved it.  The whole ""wild west"" theme prevails, and it is fun to think about cowboys and times gone by. I liked the sasparilla when I was a kid, I dont think Ive ever had it anywhere else.  Last time I was in Phoenix we went again, and while the quality of the food has maybe slid a bit since I was 5 ( um, Im kinda a LOT older now), it is still cool. I like the good mood of all the visitors, its a place that inspires laughter and happy shared experience.  If you do wear a tie, wear one you dont care about, ok. Trust me on this."

I thought about a few places and wanted to come here because of the view.  (Get it? Different Point of View.....?) Anyway, while I did initially pick DPOV because of the view, I fell in love with the perfect service AND the perfect menu. There were great options for my picky group, and not one person left unhappy, or hungry.  In addition, they seem to have a pre-fix menu with a nice price tag if youre ballin on a budget.   Everything was AMAZING and its definitely one of my favorite restaurants in DC!"

2,to make a long story short --- we had a coupon for this place.  We know its an ASU hang out but the coupon was for spend 50.00 get 25.00 off.  Ok service was not good --- when we got the bill the pizza and wings were charged separate -- not right -- it was a together order per the menu.  We had a pitcher of beer and a single beer plus food -- bill was almost 70.00 -- we gave the waitress the coupon -- she had to change the bill for the pizza and wings --- then she came back and stated the coupon had a 18% gratuity and service charge of 13.59.  Based on what ???  that actually ate up the coupon and we ended up paying full price anyway.  Never again --- and the food was fair --- not a good place to return to -- ASU take it away -- its all yours -----

The service was good, but the wait for a table was over an hour. Of course if was a Saturday night and they are having Glendale Glitters so it was really busy.

It felt to me like this hotel was trying to be a hotel that you would find in vegas.  the rooms are overpriced, there is no storage in them and they give you like 5 hangers total.  The water here is awful so dont drink it.  The pool area is nice, and the room service is very quick.  So those aspects of this hotel are nice.  I am not sure i would spend 300 buks to stay here though again.  I am not really into the party scene but if you are this might be your kind of place.  Id rather be at a pub bar or sports bar personally but to each their own!"

3,This theatre is very conveniently located in the Arrowhead mall which of course makes parking a breeze. It isnt my favorite in town because there always seem to be tons of teenagers here (im sure BECAUSE it is in the mall) and yes I know if they are too loud then we are too old. In any case the theatres are busy and bustling. The concessions seem very high but I guess that is a trade-off for the convenience.

3,"This place gets an A for effort, but I think it falls slightly short. Its neat/cute that the wasabi is actually blue, and some of their rolls (like the pink dyed rice for the Marilyn Monroe roll) are innovative, but the food is only a little above average. I liked the rolls okay, but the best thing I put in my mouth was the shrimp tempura appetizer in the martini glass. That appetizer is to die for! The miso soup was pretty good, but not my favorite. We did like the fact that there were only a few tables and it wasnt a huge place with a million people, but the food just wasnt what we expect. We are going to continue hunting for our favorite sushi restaurant in Scottsdale.....the service here was very good, though, which made the experience pretty pleasant overall."

Fully stocked bar is good to know, Go with friends, take home a ho, Steal toed boots, Dyed hair with roots, Get into the pit, Deck the guy who hits. Snoogen!!"

They quoted me 45 minutes for delivery, and when the doorbell rang after 20 I thought it was solicitors or perhaps neighbors coming to welcome us into the neighborhood. I was pleasantly surprised that it was our food.  We ordered a mushroom pizza (meh), and wings and chicken tenders - both very tasty. Were used to more thin crust pizzas, NY style I guess? so this was a bit doughy, but the garlic herb crust was yummy nonetheless. Not sure if well order from here again, unless we dont find our NY style place, but it was still good."

3,"Moved here from San Francisco, and have been searching  for decent Chinese food.  Flos has been our standby, but we tried Jade Palace on recommendations of our midwestern snowbird friends. I can only comment on the food, as we ordered take out.  Our order was ready in 15 minutes and it was complete.   I had Chow Fun, and it was the equivalent to Flos, Ok, but not spectacular, and a lot more oily.  Husband had Mongolian Beef and said that Flos was better, but the meat tasted fresher on the Jade Palace version.  Jade Palace is much closer to us, so I will try their Hot and Sour soup in the fall, which is usually the barometer I use to measure Chinese Food.  Go figure, we are now hoping for some San Francisco restaurants to relocate to Scottsdale."

Thats the only thing Ive ever ordered here (I go elsewhere for my usual espresso needs), so I cant speak on the rest of their drinks. But, I dont imagine the rest of their drinks being bad; their Iced Mochas are very enjoyable. The service can be spotty. There are a couple ladies that work there that are sweet and take good care of the customers. But Ive also encountered a couple of employees that arent friendly and/or are super slow. Whatever; Tullys isnt my usual haunt. But its good for what it is: fast-food-coffee."

After waiting to see the manager I was directed to an employee who committed slander towards me very loudly in front of everyone in the store.

If you want breakfast for dinner or a milkshake at midnight you can have it! My fiancee enjoys their french dip sandwich whereas I always try something different. I just had dental work and have been eating like a senior citizen, so I opted for the mac n cheese. It was warm and gooey with a crunchy cheese topping- a great comfort food. Late at night this place is especially fun because of the people watching."

3,"This is the place to go in Scottsdale for an Italian beef.  When I visit Chicago I usually go to Als or Portillos for Italian beef and having Als here saves me the trip to the Windy City. The decor here is nice with several motorcycles displayed throughout the restaurant for some reason.  Its neat and clean and plenty of helpful employees provide relatively quick service. I ordered the regular Als beef with sweet peppers.  I usually dont order my sandwiches ""wet"" because they come with plenty of juice already.  Good flavor and just the right size.  The fries were thick but a little greasy for my taste. All in all, a good lunch and a place to keep in mind when Im feeling like a taste of Chicago."

The food is gross, the tortillas are ok, I like the decor actually, but the employees are slutty (and by slutty I saw skirts soo short if they picked something off the floor you for sure would see vagina) Apparently the uniform is jean skirts and heels.

2,This pizza always tasted great but lately I feel like they have cheapened their ingredients. I realize its $5 pizza but it just tastes different to me now. If it werent for the flavored crust I would not come back.  But the main reason I have not returned to Hungry Howies is because the last time I wanted to place a pick up order I was turned down. I asked for a reason and was told that they received a very large company order and they were not taking regular orders at that moment.  Youd think they would be able to accommodate everyone even if a large order was placed.

A bluesman was playing nice quiet blues on an electric guitar...very nice.  Kinda scruffy place with all the basic Cajun staples.  Nothing fancy.  Decent brews.  I think the bar tender was waiting tables.  I probably wont be back, but I had heard it was great and wanted to try it.  I think I like more upscale digs and fancier/pricier fare."

Also, for a sports bar on a Friday night, I expect beers to be continually full, not waiting 10 minutes in between.

There is a reason why youre paying less for an ounce... Truly - you get what you pay for.  The concept is neat, sure, but if youre looking for pizzazz then you should try Yogurtini... Its just up the road from Yogurtland. Anyway, the single star says it all... ""Eek! Methinks not."""

Their topping are cut into huge pieces (probably to weigh more) and the topping bar is usually messy. Again, single will stick with other yogurt places."

2,"I have driven past this place a million times and never stopped, so today I did. I basically was in an overpriced Subaway called Port of subs. The sub was ok, nothing special. They do not have a good variety of bread choices and none of their subs really sounded that good. I was SUPer starving, if I wasnt I probally would have left and ate somewhere else. The staff was very nice and the place was clean. I do think I will eat there again."

3,"Jersey Mikes is okay. Its a chain place, and a bit over priced for fast food.  I ordered a philly cheese steak.  It was mostly bread, with a few thing microscopic slices of meat.  A little cheese too.  And a sliver or two of peppers.  But mostly, it was bread.  I think its funny the people that work here try to make small talk with you.  ""So, what are you guys up to tonight?""  I think it would be fun to just try and f*#k with them, and say something like, ""Oh you know, smoking a little meth and just chilling with some hookers.""  See what they say to that."

2,"I wanted to love this place so bad considering Ive lived in Venezuela and hadnt tasted some of this countrys food in over 17 years.  However it pains me to write that I was pretty disappointed.  The server, who is assume owned the restaurant, is a very nice guy but forgot my stepsons food and didnt realize until 15 mins after he dropped off our food.  My cachapa was burnt and dripping with butter.  Dont get me wrong, cachapas usually are rockin with butter but this was oozing everywhere.  The arepa was pretty decent and the only saving light of the meal but overall this experience left me wanting more."

2,I moved to phoenix from northern California where I would get my Dutch Bros. fix almost every day! Either I was spoiled by the great customer service in my area or the service here is really that horrible. Ive gone a handful of times and they have all been extremely shallow and inattentive. Not to mention theyve all charged me different prices for the same drink! One person charges me $3.50 and someone else charges me $5.25?? Get your act together and be a bit more friendly and real with your customers.

New from my last visit,  on Mill Avenue, Canteen Modern Tequila Bar and we decided to give it a try..   It had a nice open bar area onto the road and the atmosphere was lively and fun.   Happy hour was in progress and the selection of items were great.   The house Margarita hit the spot coming in at $4  on happy hour and yummy.    The happy hour appetizers were also great.    Nice selection, worth a stop with a group of friends.   Wait staff was fantastic and we had great service."

Hm...its upscale...kind of comparable to Mikunis in Sac...but their menu is to some extent, smaller and less tasty.

2,What a lame store.  The employees didnt say hi to me once and were totally unhelpful.  Their dog food selection is decent but their dog toy selection is worse than PetSmart.  Too bad too because good quality pet stores are hard to find.  There has to be something else around here and I would go out of my way to find it.

1,"We were driving around Chandler area to find a decent place to eat and Mido Sushi caught our attention. ""Oh, Okay!"" - I thought and walked right in. We were greeted right away with a good waitress, but somehow I found her voice was really annoying! The food came out after 10minutes and I was disappointed with the sashimi! It wasnt as fresh as I expected. The soy sauce tasted very weird and too salty. By far this is not the most decent sushi restaurant Ive experienced.  Kabuki and Masa sushi are still my best choice so far."

2,This Baja Fresh really didnt impress me.  Its pricey considering that all youre getting is meat in a tortilla.  It doesnt have that Mexican feel to it and is unoriginal.  There were bugs on the wall.  The food is good however.  Nothing special though.  Since its a corporate chain you cant expect sizzling flavor but I was left unsatisfied.  There are better Mexican food places to go to.

3,"This place was good, just not as good as I had hoped based on the reviews.  I would have given the place 3 1/2.  Since I cant, I decided to balance out another reviewer who gave the place 4 stars but also thought it deserved 3 1/2. Positive notes:  Hot sauce had some bite to it, chips were good, Camarones culichi had a wonderful sauce.  Lots of fresh limes served with the meal.  Full bar. Not-so-positive notes:  Shrimp in the Camarones culichi was overcooked (cardinal sin for a seafood place).  The shrimp coctail was just ok - good sized boiled shrimp, but not too much flavor.   If driving by and hungry I would stop in again, but not if I have to drive too far out of the way."

Furthermore.. what kind of authentic Chinese restaurant serves dinner out of plates? Blasphemy! Our table to had to go out of our way to get bowls! Im surprised they had chopsticks. Otherwise, their mock  food was salty and pasty, perfect for Americans in search of a good Orange Chicken replacement.  Wait.. salty and pasty?

1,"My rating is based on the fact that as a vegetarian, they charge $8 for a small mediocre bean burrito.  Maybe if this bean burrito were exceptionally good or large in size, but it was neither.  Im not saying that if your idea of Mexican food is Chipolte, you will not find what you are looking for and be happy here. But if what you offer your vegetarian customers is deleting the meat and not adding anything else and charging full price, I can get MUCH BETTER elsewhere and pay way less.   GRINGOS:  Take off the Chipolte blindfolds!  Go to a real Mexican restaurant and see what real food is supposed to taste like!"

It was so overly oily and the bun and fries overwhelmed the plate.  The shrimp and grits were so average with the shrimp being of low quality.  The beer menu looked fabulous.  So I guess if this is just a watering hole things will be fine...but if you choose to dine be prepared to leave hungry and unsatisfied.  We hope this turns around.  The decor is cool and the staff is really fun and helpful...and we are hopeful for a great place to visit in the ""hood""."

The cakes are varied and everything looks buttery good and sweet.  Having grown up near a Swedish bakery it kind of remind me of that--donuts, cakes, cheesecakes, breads and other European specialties.  The shop is also set up with a small section of Polish-centric groceries.  mmmm maybe I will have to learn to cook some Polish dishes.

I had the caldo 7 mares and it was lukewarm, wayyy too salty, and the shrimp were mushy. It was pretty gross. The carne asada tacos were mostly gristle, and I couldnt really taste my enchilidas with the thick blanket of sour cream over them. For $20, I couldve gotten much better Mexican food somewhere else."

First, dont wrap it up and let the sandwich sweat and make the bun soft and chewy. Second, put some meat on there. It was 50% bun.  It should be toasted and crunchy. And price, a 12"" chicken cheese chips and drink was $13..are you kidding me. For that price, I was hoping for the best I ever had. Change it up Capriottis or the word will get out and it will all be over in this very tough market."

There are great discounts on beer, wine, and cocktails including the awesome mango martini, and several very popular appetizers, rolls, and sushi.  I adore the chicken skewers and sliders, but my favorite are the diver scallops.  I dont think they are on the happy hour menu but they rock! Teppanyaki here is also very fun for a group and the N Scottsdale crowd is great for people watching.  Whether for a date or girls/guys night out, Sapporos energetic vibe has a lot of fun to offer."

3,"Cool atmosphere and good service. The food is good but seems they are still working on their recipes. The complimentary bread was cold (a small but important detail) and the ""salsa verde"" was mediocre. I had the Orange and Fennel Prawns and there was too much orange and barely any fennel. My boyfriend had the Lobster Mac n Cheese. Said the lobster didnt taste fresh and the sauce was too rich. Ernie, the manager came over and introduced himself. He explained the remodel from the previous concept.  Well definitely come back to support a local place at CityScape. I just hope to see some improvements in the food."

It tasted like they dropped the salt shaker in the food, but my waitress assured me that could not have happened ""because all there sauces come in bags and are pre-made"" (Gross, that did it for me) I  was outta there with the quickness..."

5,"This is by far the best Chicken Fried Steak around!  Not to mention their mashed potatoes, salad and biscuit!  Ive never been able to clean my plate here, which is great since I always have an extra meal!   Of course you can always get the lunch portion which is smaller, but then you dont have the extra goodies for later!   Its a small down home place, dress comfy and go there to eat up!  The wait staff is always the best and they know their stuff!   Ive had their T-Bone here, and its good, but really hard to go there and not get what made them famous!  Wonderful food! Prices for lunch are around $7.00 and dinner around $12.00 - really hard to beat for real down home cooking!"

1,"Have been an Ulta customer for a long time, but had never tried the salon until recently.  Was a HORRIBLE experience.  My stylist, Delia, ran 45 minutes late to start me, and on several occasions during the hair cut, stopped and kept looking around.  She made various odd faces as if to say my hair was a mess.  She not only didnt listen to what I wanted, but shot down the only thing I did ask for.  She said I wouldnt look good.  At the end of the painful ordeal, she then charged me for a conditioning service I didnt ask for.  At that point she directed me to the line at the front of the store, after which I waited in, they then sent me back to the salon to make the price correction.  (happened twice, then I asked for a manager)  Was very unprofessional all around and would NEVER go back!!!"

It had veggie stuff on the inside and I tasted a bite which was delicious.  I will probably order this next time I go.  Also, the grilled onion which came on the side was a big hit.  The other friend ordered the mushroom corn quesadilla.  She liked it but didnt love it.  I had the shrimp tacos and, wow, were they good.   I dont know why, with all the tortas on the menu, but I just seem to prefer the other menu items.  As always, the service was great, and it was very, very busy.  We had to wait to be seated.

They were very busy, but did not miss a new face at the bar or a glass writing for a refill.  The food was excellent. My husband had the baseball steak with twice baked potato and I had Prime Rib  with lobster tail and twice baked potato. Everything was cooked to perfection. Oh yes! Start with the garlic cheese bread as it is yummy!"

The first time the torta came with chips and the 2nd time they came alone.  For 6 or 7 bucks Id expect a little more.  Here are a few places with much better tortas: Los Reyes De La Torta (7th st & Hatcher), El Gallo Blanco (Central & Indian), and El Nopalito (24th st and Thomas)."

Sacks is BY FAR, the BEST egg salad sandwich (entitled ""The Dali"") I have ever had in my life. I live in North Phoenix and I will literally drive many miles just to eat at Sacks. On top of the wonderful menu, whenever you order a sandwich from them, the meal comes with a little chocolate chip cookie, which is amazing all in itself. If you like their cookies, you can purchase the cookie dough. They also make other delicious dessert bars and salads that are for sale as well. I have been eating here for at least 14 years, and I hope they NEVER go away!"

I had a half sandwich ( Sausalito Bandido?), half salad combo ( Spinach salad). Food was fresh and good. The sandwich could have stand a little more meat, it was truly flat. The salad was crisp and dressing was on the side, which I appreciated.   On my way out I got a chocolate chip cookie that was OK. I love cookies and they have to be pretty bad for me not to like them. This one, I kid you not, must have had maybe 3-4 chocolate chips? So if youre craving chocolate, this is not the cookie for you."

Granted, me and all the other people from my work were pretty loud after a sunday afternoon spring training game.  Maybe it was the girls being a little too giggly or us just having too much fun for a dive bar...but I think none of that warrants the bartender calling us cheap and rude.

Will still continue to come to this place once I stave off the embarrassment of telling people from work I know about this cool bar only to be so rudely treated by a way too snobby for a sunday afternoon bartender."
2,"Would normally give this place 4 star as I have been a regular here for about a year.  Cheap imbibe, great crowd and slap-up music. Except iodine had my first bad receive here the other sunday.  Granted, me and all the other people from my work were pretty loud after a sunday afternoon reverberate training game.  Maybe it was the girls being a little too giggly or us just having too much fun for a dive blockade...but I think none of that warrants the bartender calling us cheap and lowbred.

2,I did not stay here but went to visit out of town friends who stayed here.  The hotel was definitely not designed for anyone with any type of mobility issue - steps everywhere!  Steps to get ice.  Steps to get to the pool area.  Steps to get to the lobby.  Can you find a way around some of these steps?  Sure - if you dont mind going into the parking lot and circling around the building while cars drive past you.  The rooms seem nice but there is no way on earth I will EVER stay here.  This hotel doesnt seem to have any concern for the disabled whatsoever.

5,"So this is my current Sunday All day Happy Hour JAM! This place is SO GOOD and Im not a huge fan of all off Fox Restaurants concepts. The Chefs Pizza of the day hasnt let me down yet... We dont even ask we just order it!  The Chefs Board is pretty good too! My fav dish right now is the Broccolini - super simple but its just so light / fresh and make sure you try the Bucatini & Meatballs if your their for happy hour.  Awesome open feel to it - super friendly staff. The bartenders are great - I wanna say the dark haired brunets name was Nicole - works weekends & knows how to make a mean bloodymary / Red Rooster in their case.  The parking / Valet situation is a little annoying but remember the sign says ""Complimentary"" not Mandatory - park your car yourself if you want."

4,"Phoenix has pretty slim pickings when it comes to good pizza, or at least pizza that Im accustomed to.  Rosatis, while not quite what Im used to, is the best representation of Chicago style pizza that Ive found.   The Chicago style deep dish is good.  The toppings, especially the sausage, are plentiful and tasty and the sauce is good.  I think the crust is what is a bit off.   Overall, Rosatis is still my choice for pizza in the valley."

5,I been to many stadiums and this is one of my favorites. I attended a game against the Atlanta Braves and it was a great experience. Food prices are typical for any MLB stadium but get the combo meals and it seems cheaper. The bigger the beer the cheaper it seems. There really isnt a bad seat inside the entire place. Get there early enough and you can go down tot he bleachers during batting practice to catch a homerun hit. The staff is very friendly and talkative. If I lived in Arizona I would get season tickets. The merchandise pricing is pretty cheap too compared to most stadiums. $23 for a hat compared to $41 at Dodgers Stadium.

1,Completely shady.  Towed our U-haul as we were moving in to our new Apartment Complex.  Completely unethical and total crooks.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS!

3,Stopped in and tried both their sweet potato fries and zucchini fries. Much fonder of the sweet potatoes & the others were a little heavy?!   Like previous posts I was not to fond of their dipping sauces either. Loved their freshly prepared lemonade and the great outside spot to people watch!

1,"Not busy at all but took nearly 45 min to get our meal.  Ordered the trout and was shocked to see lots and lots of bones. Hmmmmm. Well asked the waitress about it and she said ""they try the best they can""  hmmmmmm isnt this a ""fish"" restaurant?  They comped the trout but still not sure I would go back."

2,"Not impressed, loud atmosphere, bland overpriced sandwiches. 10 employees behind the counter and no clean tables. How many people does it take to make a sandwich? More like the employees are just here to hang out with each other than work."

2,Ive been here twice for lunch. Its okay but I wont be coming back. The portions are small. I had one of the curries and it was good. But I had the pad thai which the menu said contains chicken and shrimp. Not a single shrimp on the plate. Cheap bastards. One of the lower quality Thai restaurants Ive been to in Phoenix next to Thai Hut.

5,"The name says it all. This is one hot bagel shop! This could be one of the best bagel shops Ive found in Phoenix and I would have never expected to find it way up in North Scottsdale. This bagel shop is delicious. The bagels are large, hot, soft and extremely delicious. This local eatery has a line out the door on weekends and its for a reason. The breakfast bagel sandwiches are to-die-for. The cheese, egg and bacon combo sandwiched between a hefty bagel makes it worth waking up early on a Sunday morning! I will be visiting again soon for the deli because I hear that its a must to stop by and experience their lunch."
