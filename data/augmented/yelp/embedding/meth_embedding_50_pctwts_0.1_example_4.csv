One of the decreasing quality Thai restaurants Ive been to in Phoenix future to Thailand Hut.

3,"This place was good, just not as good as I had hoped based on the reviews.  I would have given the place 3 1/2.  Since I cant, I decided to balance out another reviewer who gave the place 4 stars but also thought it deserved 3 1/2. Positive notes:  Hot sauce had some bite to it, chips were good, Camarones culichi had a wonderful sauce.  Lots of fresh limes served with the meal.  Full bar. Not-so-positive notes:  Shrimp in the Camarones culichi was overcooked (cardinal sin for a seafood place).  The shrimp coctail was just ok - good sized boiled shrimp, but not too much flavor.   If driving by and hungry I would stop in again, but not if I have to drive too far out of the way."

There are better Mexican food places to go to.

2,"I was so disappointed in this place. I just moved out here and was craving filipino food and found this place based on reviews. Although the reviews were average, I was hoping to catch this place on one of its good days. Nope, not the case.  The place is not much to look at and the food did not look good. I was hesitant to eat here but was so hungry and saw that they had my fav dishes, sinigang and diniguan. They were both ok, Ive def had better. I ordered the pancit for my husband and it was terrible! He had maybe two bites and threw the rest away.  Oh well, wont be coming back here. Theres another filipino place in Phoenix so well be trying that next. Gingeroot, also in Chandler, is way better but expensive. Guess its worth the price when you have your cravings!"

The food was literally inedible, everything was either too cold or burnt to a char, nothing tasted good. We decided to try the desert and the cream puff (Im unsure how you can mess that up) was petrified and the cream was so gross I spit it out. The smell of the flan actually made us gag, we had such an awful time I complained to the manager. She didnt even seem to care, and gave us 20% off of a lunch we didnt even eat. We were disgusted by this place, and we will never, ever go back. Dont do it, you will regret it!"

Also Shepard pie we ordered had extra ingredients such as zuccini, so they should have warned us about not being a proper Shepard pie.  Gordon Ramsay would have been mad.  Service was good. Only saving grace."

2,"I had high hopes for this restaurant, but to be honest, it let me down.  The wild mushroom and goat cheese salad was phenomenal.  From there it was downhill.  Great ambiance, though I think they are trying too hard to be a steakhouse.   Most importantly though...  Given it is a seafood restaurant, they sure didnt know how to cook my fish.  It was fried and oily (and was not marketed that way on the menu!)  I wanted something light and left feeling like I ate a ton of bricks.  My friends scallops - she said they were ""okay"" and not better than that. Oh, and the prices are set as if it were a steakhouse too. (Note: if it were, which its not.) Mediocre at best."

3,"I finally tried Spicy Pickle last week. I like the name and was intrigued about their menu. Paninis, soups, salads, pizzetas, nothing out of the ordinary. I had a half sandwich ( Sausalito Bandido?), half salad combo ( Spinach salad). Food was fresh and good. The sandwich could have stand a little more meat, it was truly flat. The salad was crisp and dressing was on the side, which I appreciated.   On my way out I got a chocolate chip cookie that was OK. I love cookies and they have to be pretty bad for me not to like them. This one, I kid you not, must have had maybe 3-4 chocolate chips? So if youre craving chocolate, this is not the cookie for you."

1,"Wow! I cant believe this place gets so many good reviews.  I was hauled here once by co-workers looking for a cheap meal. But, how much value does your lunch dollar have when you dont even want to eat the food? Dry and sticky rice; ""white meat chicken"" unidientifiable as such, and a sweet glaze that provided the only flavor. Quite frankly, it was disgusting, and none of the dishes my co-workers had looked any better (though they seemed to be fine with them). I should know to stay away from restaurants that have pictures of their menu items on the wall. The one star is only for the fast and friendly service."

1,"Have been an Ulta customer for a long time, but had never tried the salon until recently.  Was a HORRIBLE experience.  My stylist, Delia, ran 45 minutes late to start me, and on several occasions during the hair cut, stopped and kept looking around.  She made various odd faces as if to say my hair was a mess.  She not only didnt listen to what I wanted, but shot down the only thing I did ask for.  She said I wouldnt look good.  At the end of the painful ordeal, she then charged me for a conditioning service I didnt ask for.  At that point she directed me to the line at the front of the store, after which I waited in, they then sent me back to the salon to make the price correction.  (happened twice, then I asked for a manager)  Was very unprofessional all around and would NEVER go back!!!"

There are a couple bars to sit at and they even open a big door to a bar for the outside too.  They have some good brews on tap and have flat screen tvs as well.   I have only had a burger and fries here.  They burger was really good, the fries were really greasy and were just okay. The staff here is friendly & speedy.

Im not saying that if your idea of Mexican food is Chipolte, you will not find what you are looking for and be happy here. But if what you offer your vegetarian customers is deleting the meat and not adding anything else and charging full price, I can get MUCH BETTER elsewhere and pay way less.

Just basically vegetables and beef cooked in a marinade. They always have plenty of servers on hand and Ive never been disappointed. Theres just some little sparkle that it seems to be missing. I struggled between giving it a 3 or a 4, but I settled on a 3 because they could definitely improve the atmosphere a little bit and parking sucks. They are really close to the light rail now though, just get off at McDowell/Central and walk one block east on McDowell."

5,"Ah what a beauty and wonder Camelback mountain is. However I do warn beginners to use the easier trail on the East side near Invergorden which runs north south and turns into 64th st. It is a bit of a walk from the parking through the neighborhood but the hike is less treacherous and much easier and takes you up a gradual slope to the top. Be very careful its easy to loose the trail on that side too.  Of course all the Phoenicians like to go to Echo Canyon at Mcdonald and 44th street bend. Parking can be bad at peak times on weekends--I definetely recommend late afternoon hiking, less exhaustion from heat, less crowds and a glorious sunset at the top.  Happy Hiking my Dear Phoenicians."

Microwaved enchiladas, no rice, garish, cold, unfriendly, uninviting service...If youre looking for a splendid, neighborhood mexican restaurant, try Las Glorias Grill. The location shouldnt as prodigious, but the food, service and drinks, blows this place outta the water. After yr of going to tata chiladas, Im NEVER going back again. They dont deserve your money either...."

5,"Mmm!  Delicious Indian food and a great selection of vegetarian dishes. I LOVE the fact that each dish is mildly spiced, and left up to the individual to customize the flavor depending on which sauces they choose.  Im a spicy lightweight so it was great that I didnt have to worry about getting something too hot to enjoy. I had a bowl of brown rice, cumin potatoes and tofu masala with a cool yogurt-cucumber-mint sauce on the side.  It was fantastic!  I cant wait to go back. ...also, I thought it was adorable that we were given a golden dollar coin with our check for ""making the drive to their location and to compensate for high-gas prices"".

4,"I usually hate chains, especially Italian ones like Olive Garden and Romanos. But I was pleasantly surprised my Maggianos. We went because we got a gift card for Christmas but we are probably going back.  The bread and the dipping oil they start you out with is pretty good. I wish the dipping oil was just a little more seasoned though. My husband ordered the linguine and clams which he said was just ok. My stepson had the crab and shrimp cannelloni which he enjoyed. I really liked my eggplant Parmesan. It is the best egg parm I have had at a chain. The sauce is fresh tasting which huge chunks of garlic. One nice surprise is that our server said that my dish qualified for a free take home dish of the same category. So I ordered the gnocchi and had a nice dinner the next day."

Its just up the road from Yogurtland. Anyway, the single star says it all... ""Eek! Methinks not."""

1,"First off, the restaurant is dim and dark.. I thought the decor was a little off because they were going for a tropical Vietnam theme with banana trees in there and a waterfall fountain. The waiter there did not have a smile and didnt seem freindly, it looked like this was the last place he wanted to be at. The service sucked ass. I mean come on, there was only two tables including mines and 3.9/4 of the time, he didnt check up on us or refilled our water and we had to walk up to ask for our bill.. like seriously...? Are you that lazy. Bun Bo Hue was skimpy on the meat and had little veggies on the side. Pho had a rancid smell. Noodles in my sisters bun thit nuong were hard and watery (seemed like they were super old) Overall, I wouldnt recommend to ANYBODY."

I had the carne torta the first time and the cubana the second.  The food was okay.  Not bad but not filling and not as good as some other places I can name off the top of my head.  The first time the torta came with chips and the 2nd time they came alone.  For 6 or 7 bucks Id expect a little more.  Here are a few places with much better tortas: Los Reyes De La Torta (7th st & Hatcher), El Gallo Blanco (Central & Indian), and El Nopalito (24th st and Thomas)."

We were then informed that we couldnt order dinner. Maybe when they see someone coming in and telling them they are...here for dining...they potentially give them a leiter up that the galley Is closing so we can order our eating and not be told five minutes after it did close..fourth time weve given this place a and got shite service. Bartender got a buck tip and we had to go find another restaurant for breakfast, Needless to say we wont be giving them another chance. Not good Gordon B. Not well."
2,"Would normally give this place 4 stars as I have been a regular here for about a year.  Cheap drinks, great crowd and great music. Except I had my first bad experience here the other sunday.  Granted, me and all the other people from my work were pretty loud after a sunday afternoon spring training game.  Maybe it was the girls being a little too giggly or us just having too much fun for a dive bar...but I think none of that warrants the bartender calling us cheap and rude.  Come on now, we are all servers and we all tipped you well.  Whats with the attitude?  Will still continue to come to this place once I stave off the embarrassment of telling people from work I know about this cool bar only to be so rudely treated by a way too snobby for a sunday afternoon bartender."

2,This Baja Fresh really didnt impress me.  Its pricey considering that all youre getting is meat in a tortilla.  It doesnt have that Mexican feel to it and is unoriginal.  There were bugs on the wall.  The food is good however.  Nothing special though.  Since its a corporate chain you cant expect sizzling flavor but I was left unsatisfied.  There are better Mexican food places to go to.

If I would have reviewed this place 10 years ago, it would have been 5 stars but now the blinders are off and I have money to try better places. One by one they all seem to dwarf Serranos in most every way. I feel kinda guilty writing this and hope my family does not read this :) But it has to be said. I would still eat at Serranos but it doesnt have the same feeling anymore. The Chimichangas are good and their bean dip is awesome. Nothing I have had is gross or anything but its just   basic greasy mexican food. There are better places out there. Once again to any family reading this....Im sorry :)"

Nothing I have had is gross or something but its just   basic lard mexican nourishment. There are better places out there. Once again to any family reading this....Im sorry :)"

We recommended it to others as well.  Showed up on a Tuesday night for dinner and everything was packed up....?  A little searching on the web (Facebook, specifically) shows that theyre done.

2,This pizza always tasted great but lately I feel like they have cheapened their ingredients. I realize its $5 pizza but it just tastes different to me now. If it werent for the flavored crust I would not come back.  But the main reason I have not returned to Hungry Howies is because the last time I wanted to place a pick up order I was turned down. I asked for a reason and was told that they received a very large company order and they were not taking regular orders at that moment.  Youd think they would be able to accommodate everyone even if a large order was placed.

I can only comment on the food, as we ordered take out.  Our order was ready in 15 minutes and it was complete.

I had already eaten so didnt intend on a 2nd breakfast.  But stingy GF only allowed me a few bites so I had to ask Chris to whip up  another plate for me.   It was my first time having chilled salmon done that way and it was so good.  Everything tasted so fresh.   For the price you get to drink all you want.  And I must have had at least 10 glasses of the orange juice with mixed berries.   The food and the atmosphere reminds me of eating in Napa, CA.   Will definitely return when Im in town."

2,"I heard nothing but praise about the food and atmosphere of this chain restaurant.  I loved the look of this place inside and out. Great rustic barrels and old barber chairs in the bar area gave a unique look. Service was friendly and fast.  Food was less than desirable. Salad was nothing but iceberg lettuce (and I got a stump) with some shredded red cabbage. My pasta dish was spaghetti with a white clam sauce. It was too salty and there was a sprinkling of microscopic clam bits.  I always take leftovers home, this time I didnt. While the prices are good its not worth a less than average meal. Husband was equally disappointed with his chicken marsala. Chances of going back are slim to none."

5,"There are many places in the valley and its surrounding cities to eat Mexican food; however, there is one and only La Canasta. In the last two years the boyfriend and I have eaten at this restaurant location quite often. For the money, you get exactly what you pay for: a decent meal and generous portions. The chips and salsa are ever-flowing and the salsa is some of the best Ive tasted. The wait staff are generally pleasant, attentive and very accommodating. Plus they frequently recall what you had during your previous visits. I recommend you try the Machaca dinner or my boyfriends favorite dish, the number 5 lunch special. There are multiple locations in the valley, but this one beats them all hands down."

3,This theatre is very conveniently located in the Arrowhead mall which of course makes parking a breeze.

It was so overly oily and the bun and fries overwhelmed the plate.  The shrimp and grits were so average with the shrimp being of low quality.  The beer menu looked fabulous.  So I guess if this is just a watering hole things will be fine...but if you choose to dine be prepared to leave hungry and unsatisfied.  We hope this turns around.

Since I cant, I decided to balance out another reviewer who gave the place 4 stars but also figured it deserved 3 1/2. Positive notes:  Hot sauce had some bite to it, microchips were well, Camarones culichi had a fantastic sauce.  Batches of fresh limes played with the meal.  Full bar. Not-so-positive notes:  Shrimp in the Camarones culichi was overcooked (cardinal sin for a seafood place).  The shrimp coctail was just allright - buena sized boiled shrimp, but not too much aftertaste.   If driving by and hungry I ought cessation in again, but not if I have to drive too far out of the paths."
4,"Ordered the King Carlos IV.  It was HUGE, two of us ate half of it.  I thought it would be smaller than that.  It had all the major meats plus hotdogs, cheeses, and a siracha type sauce.  I think this was featured in diners, drive-ins, and dives.  It was very good but just wow huge.  It came with a side of ruffled chips.  Very nice people.  The fruit smoothies were good the horchata decent but not the best Ive had.  Great bang for your buck though.  Id go again and try something a bit more sensibly sized. There was a wait of about 15 minutes or so.  Very popular on a Saturday for lunch :)"

1,The Duce is a disaster.  As an Arizona native and a downtown local I root for cool interesting places downtown. I wanted to love this place. The 1st time we tried the Duce I was extremely let down by the customer service. The parking is atrocious. Its as if you are inconveniencing the staff by asking where you order food. They were out of just about everything we wanted to order. So disappointing.  However I decided to give them a second shot. Everyone has a rough night. We went to an event there last night the entertainment by Scandalesque was AMAZING... same TERRIBLE customer service from the staff at the Duce. Management needs to wake up. Great concept. Horrific customer service and staff.

2,"I got the banana nutella cupcake and love the banana bread-like cupcake. However, the frosting is way too sweet and overpowers the banana flavor of the cupcake. As many reviewers have already mentioned, the cupcake is also over-priced at $3.75 each for the size and the lack of creativity.  With so many desert/snack places in Scottsdale, I am unlikely to come back here."

5,"This review is for locals...the Hyatt isnt just a beautiful spot to stay it, its also a perfect spot to just sit and enjoy the day! Ive done this several times, many times for dinner and drinks afterward on the patio. Most recently, I decided to set up shop and do some work from one of the comfy chairs on the outdoor patio which allowed me to enjoy the gorgeous Arizona weather and still get some work done. They do an excellent job of making the hotel amenities comfortable and welcoming.  For hotel guests, if you are planning to stay here, be sure to look into staying in one of the rooms that sit on the man made lake. They have great patios right on the water so when you wake up, you could have breakfast on the lake! It doesnt get much better than that."
