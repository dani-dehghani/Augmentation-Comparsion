5,"Good God, where has this been hiding? My bf and I just made our periodic trip to Phoenix and discovered this little gem. From his kids, no less. 

We went during the 8pm-10pm Happy Hour...on a Friday night. We got a table in about 20 minutes for 6 of us. Our server was super friendly and took our drink order right away. The cosmos and appletinis were $4 and the sake bombs (with Kirin or Sapporo) were $5 and numerous rolls were $5 each; how do you beat that? 

The food was spectacular. We ordered off of the regular menu (2 orders or tuna tataki, 2 orders of heart attacks, and a dragon roll) and the happy hour menu (crispy spicy tuna, philadelphia roll, calamari roll, shrimp tempura roll and a couple of others that I cant seem to remember). OMG, one slice of that tuna tataki and I was SOLD. This was some seriously great sushi...Bravo Yen Sushi! 

Our bill for 6 peeps was $96, thats with the tip included, no less...YAY! I will definitely be back."
3,"Eh, lukewarm feelings about this one.  I had lunch here and the service was exceedingly slow even though the restaurant was not at all busy.  The server looked at me like a martian when I asked a question about the salad.   It may have been an off-day...  The food was good.  Inventive salads... it didnt exceed my expectations, though.  Hip mid-century modern decor...  Im not sure that I would go back on my own nickle."
4,"You can get drunk and get your nails painted.  Huh?

Its true, and it happens on Mondays.  For $10, you choose any martini you want.  Then, you drink and chat until its your turn to get your hands worked on.

The chocolate martini I ordered was strong and smooth.  Definitely not watered down...just what the doctor ordered.  

Okay, so the manicure wasnt something you might get at a spa, but it was a fun little silly girly thing, that I personally think is a great idea.  Still, for the price of just the martini alone, you get shiney new nails.  Not a bad deal.

The people watching is quite interesting as well, I even struck up a conversation with a humorous dad of a popular comedian.

Bring the girls and have some fun."
4,"OK, Sweet Pea and I love us some Coup, and its not just because weve been coming here for years- since I lived across the street and could see the restaurant from my window- or because we got engaged here (which was incredible.)  Its because the food never disappoints.  You can go to restaurants and have varying experiences from the best meal of your life to terrible, but Coup is not the place for that.  Its consistent.  And consistent can be good, or bad.
As consistently good as the food is, the service is likewise consistently slow (albeit friendly).  We went here for Valentines day which weve been several times and I highly recommend.  Its romantic without being showy.  They have a special Valentines Day set menu of 4 courses which is always interesting and good.  And, if you go on the day before Valentines Day, they still have the menu, but its cheaper.  Damn those greeting card ""holidays"".  The menu is also consistent.  The outstanding things are the brie brulee which is an absolute must-try as an appetizer, and the lamb shank.  Everything else is solidly good without being great.  The desserts are exceptional.  I like the BYOB aspect of the restaurant, although, they do charge you a lot for ""corking fees"", which amount to just charging you for nothing since they have a corkscrew sitting on the table and you are in charge of opening your own bottle.
Coup, I love you.  You get 5 stars if you vary your menu a little, please, please, please get more vegetarian (if any vegetarian) options, and improve your service."
4,"Man of man this place is gooodd - I hurt when I leave from eating their awesome beef tacos, these are from god.  They deep fry them and the beans are cheesy perfection.  So if your trying to lose weight or looking for healthy, not this place, this is the place where you sin. Red cheese enchiladas hit the spot!  

The service is great and the prices are low, of course the building could be better.  Great for pick up also."
5,"we rode our bikes here today in search of a new place to try. the online menu looked like it had a few options for non-meat eaters (although it is very much a meat heavy menu). 

for an easter sunday lunch, it was very empty, not a good sign. but we had no wait and they easily passed the water glass test. our server was very attentive and checked on us throughout the meal without being overbearing. 

the decor is ""country"" but not like cracker barrel....more like neo farm dining. 

i had the blackened fish sandwich, which was cooked really well, nice and seared but juicy, topped with onion, pickles, tomatoes and butter lettuce. i had the jalpeno and cheese grits on the side and they were rich and creamy with just a slight hint of heat...nothing to burn your mouth. 
my wife had the tuna sandwich, which was also tasty and seared just right. she did have to navigate a big piece of fascia which is not that delectable, but it was her dish, not mine. her side of gigantic asparagus tasted wonderful. 

i would love to come back here and hope they are able to make it here. well worth the bike ride."
4,"We had a group dinner in one of their private rooms... the wine room, which as decent, obviously wines all around us, but a nice room for a group of 10.  Anyways, the food we had was amazing... be sure to try the the appetizer - DRUNKEN BREAD (Cabrales fonduta, White Wine, Garlic, Herbs).  For my entree I had the RIGATONCINI w/  Sweet & Spicy Schreiners Lamb Sausage, Heirloom Legumes, Local Greens,  
Charred Tomatoes, Chili, Pecorino.  It was perfect with a nice kick to it. Definitely recommend it.  And for dessert...PRADO SUNDAE
House Made Vanilla Gelato | Apple Wood Bacon | Caramelized Bananas  Amarone Cherries | Warm Chocolate Sauce | Roasted Almonds |
 Whip Cream | Biscotti Crumble... amazing... my first bacon dessert and it was worth it.  Also, try the DULCE DE LECHE BREAD PUDDING  
Bourbon Caramel Sauce | Vanilla Anglaise | Chantilly Cream.  And get yourself a mojito while you are there, surprisingly good.  Of course this is the main restaurant at the Montelucia Resort, so expect ""hotel pricing.""  The menus are also seasonal, so my recommendations now might be completely different when you go there."
5,"In 1999, I was discharged from the United States Marine Corps.

Keeping a high and tight well maintained was a real pain in the ass because barbers dont understand what the hell its supposed to be like.  I am sure that many of you who keep this style of haircut understand.

Any barber can sit you in a chair and cut your hair.  This guy used a razor to get skin close on the sides, and a leveler (no, I am not kidding) to make sure that the cut was even.

I have gone to at least 20 barber shops in the Phoenix, Mesa, and Tempe area.  This barber shop beats them all.

This is the BEST barber shop in Phoenix.  I have been a repeat customer for 9 years, and I will keep going back until they close up shop."
1,"Slowest DRIVE THRU ever!!!! Also the quintessential SHORT BUS Location.

I frequented this location around dinner time since it is the closest to my home a few times and every time it is between a 10-15 min ordeal. When i worked at Mickey Ds in the early 90s we had what was called 90 sec HBO( Hand Bag Out), from order to picking up should be no longer than 90 secs. This must not be a practiced any longer.  I have to say hello when I drive up to the speaker due to getting no response. Then I get someone who is rude and says yes. I order the big mac deal, buy 1, get 1 for a $1. The employee says they do not offer that, I advise their menu out front does. After 5 min of silence and cars backing up I pull fwd to make sure he is still living to see what is up. Total lack of cust serv service, he had to have the mgr show him how to ring it up, no apology or anything. This happened each time I went there. Cmon man"
4,"Had dinner and brunch, not on the same day...the dinner was good, although I thought the mandala masala could have used more flavor.  Brunch was great, tried 2 different tofu scrambles and both were very good.  Service is...lets say uninterested -- its hard to be burdened with angst and chipper."
4,Byblos has some of the best Middle Eastern food Ive ever tasted. Their falafels and Tzatziki are delicious. And the restaurant serves up an amazing tomato cream soup which will have you lapping up every last bite. This is a great lunchtime destination.
2,"I ALWAYS pay in cash at this Pandas. If it wasnt across the street from work, I wouldnt go here at all.

Two separate times I have been double billed on my debit card for my lunch. Im not saying it was intentional, but either way it is annoying to have to dispute a charge with your bank.

Fair warning."
5,My husband called the chicken fajita burrito one bad ass burrito. The carne asada burrito and quesadilla were equally yummy. Nice stop for a quick bite.
5,"Wow, Chill rocks. Frank and his lovely wife, the proprietors, are fantastic. The prices are super low and the gelato/sorbet is awesome. While we were there, a little kid dropped the top part of his cone on the ground. Frank replaced it for free. 

Then he gave us a sample of the fat-free, sugar-free chocolate sorbet, which made me want to buy a pint of it... after I had already eaten a baby sized Mango/Pomegranate mix. Yum. 

How about this: Go have dinner/lunch/breakfast/whatever at Pita Jungle, then walk across the parking lot to Chill for dessert. That sounds like the perfect evening."
4,"you will wait... ALWAYS...

I COULD EAT A POUND OF THEIR HASH BROWNS. i get them to go!"
4,"Great great great tacos!
I go to a restaurant for the food first.  As long as it is clean, and Lulus is, then sitting in, what looks like a used McDonalds booth, doesnt bother me a bit.  Afterall, its a taco shop!
I like the fish tacos (the small ones) and I usually order 3 of them.  I like how they are made and it reminds me of what you can normally find in Mexico, not at these chain restaurants.
The Ceviche tostada is really good too, but is difficult to eat, so dont wear your sunday best.
Not in the mood for fish, then try the carne asada tacos or any other kind for that matter.

Lulus is a great place and a break from the Americanized Mexican Food, we see everyday.

Enjoy it for what it is!"
3,"The place was pretty empty - even for an off night. The service was pretty decent, but like I said - it was empty. 

Ive been in here a few times, but never when its busy. The prices dont impress me, but Id say you get a pretty decent pour for the money. 

One thing Id like to point out - a 1.5L bottle of Dom is less than 1000 bucks, but a 3.0L bottle of Dom is 3500. If youre a fucking idiot, get the 3L. If youre a smart shopper, youll get two 1.5L bottles or else just by the glass - which works out even cheaper. Just so you know, it works the opposite way Costco does. If youre getting a big ass bottle of Dom anyway, you probably dont care.

The decor is red. Its very dark in here at night... dark and loungy rather than clubby. Similar to Merc Bar, but not as hip or hidden... even though they try to hide it with curtains. Its also pleasantly quiet in here... easy to have conversations. 

With the patio door open, youre going to smell cigarettes people are smoking outside if youre sitting at the bar or on the couch adjacent to there. 

Its a nice bar, but I dont know that Id single it out as a ""place to be."" I actually think the Mondrian is pretty nice - but thats based entirely on good memories that are completely unrelated to the place and have more to do with the people I was with at the time. If someone wealthy and hip was here from out of town looking to party, the Mondrian is one of a handful of hotels Id suggest. Not so much because of Red Bar, but more because its conveniently located within stumbling home distance to so many other better bars in Downtown."
2,"Back from holiday and had some amazing soups that made me reflect back on my experience here.  I have to preface this review with that the owner here is quite lovely and Im sure has the best intentions, but unfortunately the soup was sorely lacking.  As a proponent of organics, I had my hopes way too high.  Well, first of all it was a bit confusing if we were to order at the counter from a very smudged, unreadable chalk board or if we were to be seated.  The owner appeared from the kitchen and said to have a seat eliminating our initial confusion.  To keep this review to the point, we ordered a smoothie, bland.  A frittata, very small and actually strange as if it might have been cooked in the microwave, need I say more.  Two bowls of soup, one was a bean with kale, unfortunately the beans were not thoroughly cooked and the flavor was not allowed to develop.  The other a red pepper concoction, that another diner suggested, was one dimensional and needed copious amounts of help sprinkled with some love.  
When paying these boutique prices one expects and should get a better quality, culinary creation.  These soups needed proper development and herbal infusions that the kitchen obviously lacks.  I would like to offer a suggestion that may help her, so she can spend more time with the soup prep and less time running around the table up front, and that is to consider a different style of service.  The place is so small that she could have customers order from the chalkboard, if readable, and then deliver the orders.  I wish her the best in her endeavor."
4,"Today was our first time eating here, so armed with great reviews from other Yelpers, we sampled a bevy of appetizers from the happy hour menu (daily from 4:30-7p) and shared a pasta entree. Of the apps, we had toasted ravioli, a platter of antipasti, and by recommendation from our lovely server, Amber, the stuffed eggplant.  The toasted ravioli was delicious-crispy and battered with a crust of parmigiana, melty cheese on the inside. A dip in the flavorful and slightly spicy marinara sauce finished it off.  

The antipasti platter serves about 2 light eaters, but for me and my spouse, it was a nice compliment to the two other shared appetizers. 

The stuffed eggplant was covered inside and out with gooey, cheesy goodness and marinara sauce.  This was to be the main portion of my meal while my husband had gorged on the appetizers, but after a taste, he started sneaking bites while I wasnt looking!  I added some chili flakes for a little heat, but It was very flavorful.  Im not a huge melted cheese lover and wouldve preferred a little less cheese, but it was perfect for my husband.

The restaurant wasnt super busy when we arrived at 6pm, but by the time we left around 8pm, the main dining room and the adjoining small rooms were about 85% filled.  The prices were higher than what we normally spend, but we had been given gift cards by my brother and happened to come during happy hour, so it wasnt that bad at all. Our bill came out to about $17 without tip and we didnt order drinks.  

You do have to sit in the bar area to receive the happy hour specials, but we didnt mind.  Well be back!"
5,"You know when you get a really good cut and color.. When the stylist is done and you look in the mirror and say ""Wow, you did a great job. It looks awesome"".

Well that was my experience yesterday. I was a bit hesitant to go to the training academy, but in these rough economic times every penny counts and their prices are fantabulous.  

It is really hard to find someone that does a great job on your hair the first time you see them. My stylist was Sara Groves and I am now a customer for life. I have the feeling she is going to have a very lucrative career doing hair, too bad her prices will triple in a few months. She sat me down and asked me all about my hair, my style, the products I use ect. The best part of the entire experience was that she really listened to me and cut my hair exactly how I asked. I wanted peek-a-boo highlights in my bangs, and even though she thought it was an odd choice (and asked me if I was sure a few times ;) she gave them to me. I was extremely pleased with both my cut and color. When the receptionist rang me up I almost couldnt believe the price.. Cut and color for under $50.. WOW!"
4,"While in the area we wanted something for lunch but knew wed be having dinner out that same evening. Not wanting to fill up too much we ordered an appetizer and entree to share. 
The lettuce wraps with shrimp were so good! Fresh and crispy veggies accompanied seasoned shrimp all wrapped in butter lettuce leaves. It was light and tasty. For our entree we ordered the Hawaiian mahi mahi which came with a pineapple, red pepper and onion mixture over a bed of rice. The fish was a little overcooked but still tasted pretty good. Star for the water glass test!"
5,"I got a coupon at a past Yelp event to try them out and Im SO glad I did!  Massage Envy really exceeded my wildest expectations for a chain that offers affordable rates for massage therapy.  I was pleasantly surprised by the level of expertise and professionalism that I experienced!

My massage therapist was Dannie and she worked through my trigger points and loosened my tight muscles with an intuition that I have rarely experienced.

I highly recommend this place and hope to return soon!"
5,This place is classic goodness! Everything tastes rich and fresh! Has a new modern feel with a twist of luxury and artistic flare. The food presentation is gorgeous and the food tastes even better then it looks! In a wonderful area of town and is built in the old post office. An inventive and one of a kind idea has really set apart this delicious place from any other restaurant in the valley!
4,"Gotta get the hot wings! Theyll make sure you know what youre getting into, but even if you havent had them before, just play along. Theyre worth it."
5,"Ive been using mineral makeup for a couple years now and Bare Escentuals is the best in my experience. You can order their stuff online as well and its free shipping after a certain amount, but I like being able to ask questions and compare things side by side before I buy, and the salesgirls are always really helpful with that. Once I find a product Im loyal to, then I do the online thing. This stuff just feels much better on your skin and doesnt clog your pores. It seems like an initially pricey investment when youre first getting started, but mineral make-up keeps much better and I can use less of it to achieve the effects I want."
3,I thought the place had a lot to offer with the atmosphere and the ingredients used in the all of the dishes.  I only thought that the menu spoke louder than the dish.
5,"This is the new mecca of Phoenix music. 

Charlie Levy who booked for the now legendary Nitas Hideaway and also the owner of Stateside Presents is the man behind it all! He is a music fan first and ... well ... thats just what he is ... a music fan not a natural businessman. 

The place is just beautiful (for now, soon to be broken with the wear and tear of rock and roll no doubt). The room is small ... stage big (for the size) ... no doubt this is going to be the best place in the city to see any band for a long time to come!

Thank you Charlie!

Music fans unite! This place MUST thrive!

btw ... they have live music every single night of the week ... and they open at 4pm every day (the lounge will have musicians and DJs for your entertainment)."
2,"I so wanted to love this place. Id heard great things about the food, love the concept and was looking forward to a wonderful experience. What a disappointment. 

We were seated within 20 minutes or so of arrival, which was great considering the crowd. It was nice to have somewhere to walk around, and we were able to serve ourselves tea and coffee while we waited. 

Once seated, however, it took 20 minutes for anyone to take our order, and another 45 for the food to come. Our food arrived cold. Husband and I both ordered eggs ""over medium;"" mine were runny and undercooked, his were hard and scaly. ""Home fries"" were a mound of mushy, under-seasoned potatoes. We were offered jam when the food came, but the waitress never returned with it. My husband asked one of the other staff if they had any jam, received a curt, ""yes"" as a reply, but they didnt offer to help in any way. 

For the prices (average $10 plus $2.25 for a self-serve drink), I can think of many places Id rather spend my dining dollars. Yes, the grounds are lovely and I like that most of the food is from local suppliers (which does not mean it was raised on THIS farm, BTW), but there are many lovely patios in Phoenix with much better food and service."
4,"Cliff notes
- Cheap: $1-2/plate
- Fast: Its ready-to-go and on a conveyor
- Acceptable quality: Im here weekly and havent gotten sick lol

This place is definitely good for what it is, ""it"" being a budget-friendly sushi place thats great for a quick bite.  In a response to the lower-rating reviews stating how the food is just okay at best or authentic or blah blah blah, well think of it like wal-mart vs. *inserthighendretailerhere*.  This place has a business model based on selling in large volumes (hence the low prices like wal-mart) so theyre gonna have to ""reduce costs"" somehow (so-so quality food, not-so-attentive staff, and slightly smaller than average portions), but its still a solid bang-for-your-buck kinda place.

On top of this, I can be in and out quickly since everything is already prepared, perfect for those quick 30 min lunch breaks.  All thats required is for you to grab it off the conveyor (depending on whether or not all the items you want are on the conveyor at the time). 

Ive never had issues with seating, but do not make a point to go during peak hours and usually go with a small party (2-4 people).

For those claiming to be ""left to fend for themselves"" due to an inattentive staff, most of your sushi-related inquiries can be answered by this thing called ""the menu"" that sits on the counters.  See, this miraculous piece of technology contains things referred to as ""descriptions"" on them that help to inform you about the sushi going round-and-round before you.  Furthermore, theres even a pricing guide based on the color code of the plates to assist you further! WOW! Lol wtf do people expect for $1-2 plates of sushi?  Someone to hold your hand? LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL DIAF

And the cherry on top? $4 large japanese beers and $5 sake bombs! HELL YEAH!"
5,"Ok, so I know that this private shooting club has had its share of problems with membership and maintenance issues but I have to say, in the last 6 months, under the direction of a semi-new board of directors, the range facilities have been greatly improved. 
The members can enjoy shooting pistols or rifles pretty much all day every day uninterupted except when a scheduled match is on the club calendar located at www.phoenixrodandgun. This new fully updated calendar is really cutting down on the number of scheduling conflicts between match directors and members. Also, since aquiring new Range Staff, the number of complaints about other members or range employees has gone way down. I do have to say, the range which is located right in central phoenix is affordable, practical and overall a great shooting experience."
5,"MEOW! This place is great - super clean, loaded with an amazing assortment of natural foods for both pooches and kitties, and two fridges jammed full with raw diet selections!  My four-footed kids were in heaven going through the bags!

Not wanting to offend anyone in my bunch (its impossible to travel anywhere with three dogs and two cats, while simultaneously maintaining any level of decorum), I went solo this weekend to support the latest AzRESCUE effort being sponsored by the store. In addition to them sending me home with a complimentary Yoghund for each of the kids, I got some great insight to private training that my youngest is in desperate need of if he ever hopes to be socially acceptable, and some great toys for the felines. The staff was unbelievably nice, they have some truly unique items, and the prices range from ""wow thats pretty cheap"" to OMG do I dare?!!!

This is a great option to the chains and big box stores, so grab your leash, wag that tail, and pad your way on down to the Noble Beast!!!"
4,"Sure its walking distance from my house - so I was hoping I would have a new place for my morning tea.   After finally re-opening after the fire on 16th and Bethany Home, I was excited to check out Lucis.

The design of the the place is fantastic simple, sexy, a little modern and throw in some retro corner grocery feel.  I was greeted with fun, friendly service, and then left with a great pastry and a tasty ice tea for the road.  

They seem to still be working out some kinks since the re-open, but I see it only getting better.  In fact I just got myself excited.  I think I am going to head over there now for my morning snack."
4,"Q. How do you fix a broken pizza?
A. With tomato paste!

Ok, that sucked.

Spin-at-Os pizza is actually how its pronounced as the owner learned to make pizza in Baltimore MD home of the Orioles or Os for short. Ok, I just made ALL that stuff up but it would have been cool. Right?

Spinato""s pizza and calzones are amazing. Very heavy and sauce rich. If youre on a diet STAY AWAY. If youre not calorie counting-COME HERE. Their thin pizza is very thin and very good! We got the baked spaghetti w/meatballs calzone and it was what youd expect but wow was it great. 

Only downside after eating here: FOOD COMA ZZZZZzzzzzzZzzzzz :)"
3,"Eh, this place is okay.  I was not super impressed.  The food was okay.  I was not blown away.   After being seated, we sat at the table for a good 15 minutes without anyone noticing that no one had been to our table once.  We had to flag down a server.  Once we actually did have a server, the service was good.  I can forgive the glitch.  Everyone has a bad night.  But the food just lacked the wow factor.  Even though I have a twenty dollar gift certificate (to make up for the initial service issue) I have not been back.  I guess that about sums it up."
1,"Great in its day, now leaves a lot to be desired.  Deserves credit as a Phoenix landmark Chinese restaurant.  

This restaurant has been here for 38 years.  Ive been going here off and on for 35 years.  I go here more for sentimental reasons, and not so much for the food.  

The interior still retains some of the original decoration style from the original restaurant established nearly 40 years ago.  The rest of the decorations have been torn out.  I believe the decor is modeled after the Forbidden Palace in Beijing - see the vault-of-the-heavens style crenelations in the ceiling.  

I have this restaurant - in its former self - to thank for this:  Back in its day, this restaurant was really great, and the entire atmosphere lent to an ambiance that actually inspired me to study Chinese and then later go live over there for some years. 

Sadly, the food here is not all that good.  The fryer oil they use here is pretty old.  The fried rice arrives looking almost black (from the fryer oil?  too much soy sauce?) instead of a rich golden brown, and tastes overcooked somehow.  The eggrolls are just OK.  Definitely not fresh.

A lot of the menu items from the original owners are no longer on the menu; for example the special ""Chinese cakes"" served on a plate topped with a delicious gravy-like brown sauce and shallots - probably some form of Cantonese food.  All of this is gone, and replaced by very plain fare, and not very good at that.  

If you like salty, greasy, plain-tasting yet somehow edible Chinese food not far from the $1-per-scoop variety, then go here.  Golden Phoenixs heyday as a great restaurant is long-gone.  Let us bow our heads in sadness to a place that once was very good - now passed on..."
4,"Very good food! We ate some shrimp tacos and macaroni and cheese. They split our tacos up for us and didnt charge for it...the portions were great too!

Our server was friendly as well. Would definitely return!"
4,"Ive gotta say, Nordys (as my aunt refers to Nordstom since its her favorite department store ever) is always a safe bet if youre looking for quality selection, customer service, and a very pleasant shopping experience.  Whether youre looking for shoes, lingerie, cosmetics, apparel, etc... youll likely find it at Nordys.

Ill have to take Samantha Os and Julia Ts advice and remember to go to Nordstoms next time I need a new bra.

In the meantime, Ive gotten lucky with shoes, all kinds of clothes, accessories, and perfume.  This weekend is a big sale.  I ran in earlier to return something and walked out with a new pair of shoes.  Oops.  Take that as a warning, Nordstrom can be dangerous for shop-a-holics.

The only times I have not gotten lucky at Nordstrom are when Ive been on a mission for something specific - such as Converse Sneakers in Jareds size 7 or a certain shirt or bathing suit in my size.  But Ill overlook these times and return again and again... Keep up the good customer service and selection, Nordys - and Ill be a customer for life."
5,"When I mean 5 star, I mean 5 STARR...but this place is SPECTACULAR!! Pavle & Charleen are such a fantastic duo....they really know how to make your dining experience exquisite!  The food, not to mention the service, is truly unbelievably delicious!! If you want to have some amazing food and get top notch service while doing so, the time has come for you right here in beautiful Arizona!!
HATS OFF FOR FnB!!"
5,"By far my favorite restaurant in valley. Deliciously spicey. A bit pricey if youre picking and choosing items but theyre complete meals are a pretty good bang for the buck. 

Not actually sure about the service as Ive only gotten takeout but if its any where close to the quality of food, then it must be awesome."
1,"We use to visit this Pub 10 years ago because they had a nice English waitress and excellent fish and chips for the price.  However, we went back a few weeks ago and boy were we disappointed.  The price of the fish and chip dinner went up and they cut the portion in half.  No one assisted us in putting two tables together, we had to do it ourselves.  Two guests wanted a good English hot tea and they didnt brew it in advance, it was just thrown into a small metal tea pot and we had to ask for cream and sugar.  So weve decided there are newer and better places to eat fish and chips, especially up in north Phoenix."
5,Love it here!  Always unique and slightly dark art.  Definitely a go see if you are in phoenix~
4,"The Hyatt Place Scottsdale is a hidden jewel in old town, just off the main drag this place is perfect for a weekend getaway.  They offer complimentary breakfast which is pretty standard but nice and even have ""real"" plates and utensils vs. plastic products.  They also have free WIFI and the rooms are HUGE!  It is a great place to take the family since the kids can stay in the first part of the room on the sofa sleeper while you can crash on the comfy bed closer to the TV.
The only reason I give 4 stars vs. a perfect 5 is because the pool is really small and not that great.  If they upgraded the pool a bit they would be golden."
2,"I love the outdoor space at this restaurant. We had a very friendly waiter serve us. We started out with a delicious gin cucumber cocktail which was so refreshing. For an appetizer we had the chicken arugula flatbread that was tasty but definitely could of used a bit more flavor. The caesar salad made with kale was so salty that we were not able to eat much of it. The romaine salad was okay, nothing special. The entree, halibut was so dry it was totally inedible. The roasted vegetables were just so-so. I ate here in December and loved it but this time I was very disappointed. I am in no hurry to return, except for a drink."
2,"My name is Christi and Im a carb addict. Bread with my pasta. My lovers pizza crust (classy, oui?). Hashbrowns with my French toast. 

Ive tried to quit, but I cant. And, Ive also resigned myself to the life-is-too-short theory, so what the hay, bring on the starch.

I did almost get a salad at Bar Louies because it was a pretty late dinner and I wanted to save room in my belly for dirty martinis. But, they have an appetizer that I couldnt live without trying - Warm Pretzel sticks. 4 huge soft, warm pretzels covered in salt, served with cheese sauces and honey mustard dip. Simple, yet during my carb withdrawl that night, it was the greatest tasting thing I had ever eaten. 

I can vouch for the pretzels, but other than that, the service blew chunks. Over 15 minutes to get shots of jager when we were the only table in our servers section. When people order jager, that means theyre on a mission, so give it to them...fast! 

We canceled our drinks and left to drink wine in our hotel room. We knew wed get drinks faster there. 

If youre gonna go, go for the pretzels, not for the jager."
4,"I have stayed in this hotel a few times. I think overall its good. I am happy with the golf view. The restaurant is alright.

Update 9/7/07 - I stayed over at this Hotel again....really great customer service!"
5,"This place had me from the moment our waitress asked us if it was o.k. if our water was infused with the flavor of cucumber.  Heck yeah it was o.k. in fact I dont even want to order a drink, I just want the free cucumber water!  My buddy and I decided to start with an app. order of sweet potato waffle fries with dipping sauce.  Delightful!  I ordered the sweet potato and garbonzo burger and the sweet potato and avocado salad side dish.  Notice the sweet potato theme??  I love those crazy orange taters!  The food was really tasty and quite flavorful.  The burger was a little different than I expected because it didnt come on a bun..but no biggie.  In typical girl fashion, my buddy and I split a cupcake...finger lickin good!  I am picky-picky but this place won me over big time!  Also, I felt that, for the location, their prices were very reasonable.  The prices for those condos located upstairs..well thats gotta be a different story!"
5,"From the moment I walked into the lobby the staff displayed a level of professionalism that you dont get to see everyday. Each staff member that I came into contact with gave me a handshake and said, ""Welcome to our business"". I dont normally enjoy going to the dentist, but this has been the complete opposite. They made me feel very comfortable and confident that I was going to be happy with my experience, and I was!  So I set up an appointment for my 9 year old son on the way out. Since then we have both been in to have work done. My son need one filling and he took it very well, then trotted off to school like nothing ever happened. I started with a deep cleaning from Bobbie Lynn Tucker , RDH.  She was very nice and personable, did a wonderful job cleaning my teeth, not to mention gentle. I was never in any pain either during or after the procedure.  My following visit was with Dr. Brittian, DDS.  I needed a few fillings and I am very pleased with his work. Again gentle and quick.  My teeth look beautiful and feel wonderful. They were great with explaining all the costs and have cool perks like a Rewards Program.  I also liked the glass back wall that gives the patient a private calm view of the outdoors. The flat screens are cool too, but my only complaint is that when I asked quite seriously if they could change the channel, ( I dislike sport shows a lot) they were not going to budge. That might be something they want to work out. Other than that I really would recommend  them to everyone."
5,"Love massages and facials!

I would highly recommend Enrique for a massage.  Great technique.  Great membership prices and great walk-in schedule for those last minute needs."
5,I really like this Urgent Care!  Dont let their youthful looks fool you! John Altic PA-C and Dr. Brenden McRae are wonderful and very caring! In addition to having Urgent Care they are now opening a Private Family Practice -I cant wait for them to be my primary care physicians as well.  Great job gentlemen and staff!
5,"20% off with a Yelp check in? SCORE! 

They have very unique, colorful and patterned vintage clothing for sale. But what I liked most about this store is their vintage jewelry! Theres a local jeweler who makes rings out of old school buttons and brooches. I snatched up two really cute vintage rings."
5,"This is by far my favourite department store, hands down. I have had nothing but perfect experiences in this store, without exception, no matter what department Im in. The shoe SAs will bend over backwards to help you find a specific shoe, and the staff will even go so far as to send out hand-written thank you cards to your home address after you make a purchase - big or small. Tim & Anthony in the shoe salon are fabulous beyond words! 

I am not completely sure that I understand why people complain about the amount of merchandise on the floor or the lack of crowds in this store. Frankly, I would rather not be bombarded with merchandise and other people. One of the things I love the most about Barneys is not only the prompt attention of SAs, but the fact that they arent rushing around trying to help 35 people at once. The SAs at Barneys are incredibly friendly and will stop to have an actual conversation, regardless or whether you are purchasing something or not. I have also never experienced a ""high pressure"" sale situation here.

All in all, Barneys is pricey, and there is no getting around it. But, um, so is Neimans and that place is a crock. Anywhere that ONLY accepts American Express or their charge card and then treats you like scum if you arent carrying neither is no place that I want to spend my hard earned dollars. Yay Barneys!"
5,"I totally love this place. It reminds me of the old school hardcore Chinese restaurant my parents used to take us when we were kids :D 

The decor is amazing- unlike more Chinese places in Phoenix. The walls are a teal blue, adorned with large carved pieces of artwork depicting scenes in China, golden dragons and more. The lights hanging from the ceiling are amazingly ornate. The place looks like its from a bygone era (doesnt help that its in a run down strip mall) but it is clean and charming inside.

The service was great- kind to our 2 yo, and very attentive. The food was the best part- I cant remember the last time I had such good Chinese food, and its priced very reasonably. We got the Peking dinner for 2 which included the fried noodles, hot tea, wonton soup (with generous noodles, meat, shrimp and veggies, the best Ive ever had), a pupu platter with eggrolls, bbq skewers, house wings and those cheese puff thingies (the presentation is pretty cool, too). Next came 3 entree sized plates of food: mongolian beef, fried chicken (cant remember the name) and the Peking fried rice. The meal concluded with incredible little desserts- sort of like eggrolls but filled with banana and then covered with crystalized honey. I could have eaten 100 of them! Adding in a beverage and tax, the meal was only $34! 

My 2 yo can really eat, so I am surprised and pleased to say that even with sharing the dinner for 2 people with him, the 3 of us walked out with lots of leftovers. Highly recommended. Do it! DO IT!"
5,"Very yummy, my favorite roll is the Las vegas, and here they make a good one and its 1/2 off during happy hour. I keep meaning to come for the all you can eat sushi! Try the Ice Cream sushi roll, this is one of the only places I know that does it and it is delicious!"
4,"Yup. Definitely a fancy mall for that credit card burning session.

A combo of outdoor and indoor. You probably can find most everything the average person cant afford here. 

It seems to be the spot for malling in Scotsdale."
4,"The staff is really helpful.  I arrived without credit card due to a travel mishap and they were great about providing assistance to get me to a bank to help clear things up.  Their bell staff is friendly and knowledgable.  They can and will get you anywhere in town.  

Room was okay.  Clean, well furnished and updated.  I had a window overlooking the courtyard and I would recommend avoiding that.  It can get a little loud at night.  

Banquet food was good.  Not great, but good and plentiful.  Good variety of dishes for everyone from salads and sandwiches to hot dishes.  A few of the items were a little salty for my taste but with a buffet style service, if something didnt suit, you could replace it with something else.  The break service was astonishing--they really go all out!  

If you are visiting during the right weather, do not miss the pool area.  Its fantastic!"
1,"My wife and I live around the corner, hadnt eaten here in a few months. We got food for take out, Mongolian beef,kung po chicken,pad Thai noodles.  Mongolian beef, there were more white onions then scallions and it was very bland. Kung po chicken,lots of white meat chicken the whole dish only had one peanut and the taste of this dish was non existent. Very very Blah... Pad Thai noodles,the dish was dry and came out of the container in one giant clump. It tasted like plain noodles, i was glad I had peanut sauce in the fridge to,add to it. Then it was edible .... We will not be going back to G@S.. Very disappointed !!!! From now on it will be Jade palace on 92nd street. For take out Asian !!!!  Do yourself a favor go elsewhere !!!!"
4,"What can I say, this place is an Albertsons... 

Definitely not high-end like Whole Foods, but not bottom of the barrel either. It is always clean, bright, and organized. The selection is vast, and since Ive seen things behind the scenes, I know they work hard to keep only fresh and undamaged food on the shelves. 


disclosure: I used to work here"
4,"Good food and able to manage a large group easily. Our party had 11 and there wasnt a long wait at all. Highlights: spinach and artichoke dip, onion rings, and tortilla soup. Total tab was only $160 for the whole group."
1,"PIECE OF **** manager wouldnt put air conditioning on yesterday. It was 90.
They just lost alot of business."
5,"Did you know that Malees on Main offers cooking classes!?  They offer them twice a month during tourist season and once per month during the rest of the year.  I attended two weeks ago, and it was OUTSTANDING!  Not only did we learn to cook Thai (which, incidentally, it was significant to learn that Thai gets its flavor by layering is sauces), but we were given the recipes for some of the signature dishes, served tastings, a meal, and wine pairings, and we were even given goody bags.  It was a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon with another foodie!"
4,"Wound up at Rock Bottom by chance had been wanting Carrabbas all day, due to being brain washed by commercials on TV so that when a friend said lets go out for dinner I was all gun ho to say Carrabbas, then he said Im in the mood for steak I tossed the pasta idea out the window and said Bring on the beef,  plus never been to Rock Bottom so I was thrilled at being able to try a new place! It was a Sunday night and the place was simi empty, which was nice. Service was fast and friendly and I liked the overall vibe of the place. I ordered the Texas Fire Steak which was top sirloin seasoned with crazy peper and smoking jalapeno butter, man it was delish!! Even the veggies were good!  Looking forward to another trip there to try out some more the menu!"
4,"Beer is almost a 4, food is a 3, service was a 4.5.  + Check in deal makes it a 5.  Add that up and divide by the hungry fellow and you get a 4.  

I got a pretzel and an oatmeal stout pulled pork burger.  Forget the pretzel, its a essentially a utensil to enjoy their amazing sauces.  Even if you dont like pretzels or the sauce, it makes for a great palate cleanser between beers.  The burger was nothing spectacular.  I dont know where the oatmeal stout in the sauce, but it might have been in there. 

Best part of the trip was getting a got a complete education beer mixology.  WHAT PEOPLE MIX BEERS!   I learned about the Stumbler and the Snake bite; ask and you shall receive.  

Sampler note: Make sure to bring another mouth to finish a sampler, unless you plan to taxi and walk home.  
Beer Recommendations:
Lady friend who hates beer: Snake Bite
Hop Head: Pale
Complex Beer Drinker: Stumbler or MonkeyShine

Pilsner.  light and amazing wheat finish, I can drink this all day
Blonde ok little citrus, Pilsner was better
Pale. Light with dry bitter finish, not for average drinker 
Red. Simple hoppy red 
Brown. a bit darker crispy red
Oatmeal. Not smooth enough for a dark oatmeal,  surprisingly a bit hoppy 
Old Monkeyshines. Simply intriguing

 If you are looking for a clean cut safe beer place with decent food and some beer geeks, Nimbus is your place."
4,"Ok....my 2nd review of an ""Irish"" pub.  And were getting closer.  Good ambiance - I really thought it looked much like a few pubs I visited in Dublin (tho no pictures, that I saw, of the famous revolutionaries, no flags, no old photographs.  But a good draft beer selection.  And a really good Irish menu - we had the fish sandwich and the banger sandwich (lunch menu) which included chips (french fries) and I ordered a side of curry dip for the chips.  Good stuff.
Good Irish music (cds) playing in the background - not obtrusive.  And a very good wait staff.  The bartender greeted us the minute we walked in. But sorry, folks, music is Thurs thru Sat and no Irish music that they admitted to - cover bands instead.  So Ill keep looking, but Ill stop here when Im in the neighborhood."
5,"The mall of malls, for sure! So many designer boutiques, so little time! On this trip, I was given the utmost in attention from the fabulous women at the Fossil store....what fun they were! I enjoyed a smoked chicken & black bean salad @ Z Tejas next and the service was excellent. I then perused the new styles at Aqua before finding a great pair of shades at Solstice = shoppers bliss :)
This review is a bit late; I visited the center on 1/27/12 - and Ill be back :)"
3,"OH this shop makes me want to lose a hip or something just to fit into their clothing!!  I found not one thing in larger sizes, but my friend, whos a size 8, found LOTS of awesome vintage clothes...including, yes ladies and gentlemen, a 70s JUMPSUIT!  I am drooling and green with envy, but alas, I couldnt find anything.  Go here if youre thin (or just want to torture yourself by staring at all the awesome clothes that wont fit you unless you chop off some body part you probably need)."
3,"I discovered this place on my way to a comedy show! It was a Saturday night with an ASU game on and was not packed so we stopped in to get a drink and a bite to eat. First impression was nice! Everything looked clean and open, which i didnt expect from the outside appearance. 
The service was kinda slow. I have worked in the restaurant/bar industry for 10+ years and I understand how things can go wrong that the customers dont see so i am not going to be hard on these guys. (By the way, the girls are all dressed pretty skimpy and the guys are just short of guidos, so if you have small kids this may not be the place to bring em) So the drink service was slow and throughout we never were really sure who our server was. One girl took our drink order, another brought them, someone else took our food order, someone else brought our food, and someone else came over to see if all was ok... There had to be 15 employees and maybe 25 customers, not to mention the kitchen staff. 
So the service was slow and not sure why because we were constantly seeing the staff goofing around with one another and as mentioned before it was not busy. BUT the associates were very nice the entire time so it was not bad service my any means, just slow and a little unattentive. 
It seemed to turn into a club style late at night, which could explain the extensive staff. 
There is a wheel that you can spin with different actions on it, such as, ""kiss a random 50% off bill"" ""go plastic"" (which apparently gives you a chance to win plastic surgery). I would suggest NOT attempting this if you are not single. 
Overall, the food was GREAT!!!! The place was clean (bathrooms could use attention). The service could use some tweeking. But we were happy with it!"
1,"So, what kind of place serves chicken fingers and NO Ranch dressing?????? The only sauces they had was honey mustard and ""Canes Secret sauce"" Can I say EEWWWW!! I thought that the sauce tasted terrible. I am not too big a fan of honey mustard but I do On occasion eat it if there is nothing else And that wasnt even good! The coleslaw was awful also. I do have to say that the chicken fingers were very juicy but also very bland. Those were the only 2 items that I tried, not that there were really any more items  on the menu, Texas toast? And Fries I think?? Overall, I would never go back."
3,"Wed wanted to try this place for a while. We went there for lunch and had a cheeseburger, fries, and coke. Everything is ala carte which makes it a little pricy (came to nearly $9). The burgers are OK, not bad, but not as big or as fantastic as Id hoped. The fries were really good though...extra crispy. The atmosphere is really relaxed and friendly. We had our 9 month old and there werent any high chairs that we could see, so it made it hard for us to eat (one had to hold her the whole time). Overall it was a nice place but not as great as Id expected. We will try it for breakfast though sometime because the ratings on that seem to be pretty good."
3,"Im giving the 3 stars solely for 1 reason: 
The veggie sandwich! 

Theres normally only 1 person waitressing/taking orders, so expect a slow turn around during breakfast & lunch time. To avoid the crowds Id pick up a flier in the morning, call around 10 am & pre-order for pick up. If I had no time to wait to check out I would simply ask for delivery. A girls gotta eat! :)"
2,"Waited for Mad Men characters to walk in! Seriously? Went here last night for the first time, ordered 3lb stuffed lobster, stuffed with crab & scallops, lobster was tougher than nails, scallops were tasteless, crab was ok, charged an additional $15 for this stuffing but neglected to tell us until after I questioned the bill. Hubby had a 3 lb. not stuff lobster, but were tough, questioned it and was told ""they are sometimes tough"", Server was great! They have absolutely no idea how to make a dirty martini! The ONLY good I can say is that the bread was great. Not going back here, seemed to me that the crowd in the bar was well over 70 and the crowd in the restaurant was mixed! Reservations? Not needed at all, the place was empty."
2,"We were excited when we found that we could add George and Sons to our delivery list.  The food is good, not great, but it was a great option on lazy nights.  Tonight when the food was delivered it seemed like the price was a bit high.  There wasnt an itemized receipt attached to the credit card slip so I said to the delivery guy this seems high.  He gave no explanation so I tipped as usual.  Well turns out that there is a $4 delivery charge so this guy made a pretty big tip for driving down the street. I have no problem with delivery charges because there are some crappy tippers out there; I just hate having extra charges slipped onto my bill with no explanation. This will probably be the last time we order."
5,My favorite place in the world to eat! Great service and awesome food!
4,"Right around the corner from my sisters ghetto-tastic shack, this place is bomb. Green chile tostada...hell yes! 

The place is not much to look at from the outside, not much to savor on the inside, but the only people hanging out here are Chandler High kids escaping 4th period. 

You stand in line, you get your paper bag of greasy goodness, you leave with a smile on your face. 

You hope your sister has beer in the fridge when you get back to her place."
3,"From the outside the place looked alot busier however, Not a bad place to go for lunch on Friday afternoon. Especially when its close to 1pm as the place was pretty empty. My coworker order brisket tacos and they came out stuffed with tons of brisket. She said they they were very good and I will take her word for it as they looked pretty tasty. Now me, I am not an enchilada person however the enchilada de avocado sounded pretty good as it had two of my favorites stuffed in in, avocado and artichoke. I must admit that it was pretty good. I only finished a little bit of it as I had filled up on the warm chips and salsa that was served when we sat down. Yum. 

So why only three stars? Well Its actually 3.5 stars as although the food and the company were great, the service was a little off. Like I said the place was empty and yet our server either forgot about us at times or was busy doing something else in the back. Nicole, our server was sweet enough but still.... hmmm. Oh well no biggie. It was empty and we did get in and out in under an hour but not 5 star worthy. Will I be back again? Probably as the food was pretty good. Heck the chips and salsa alone are worth giving it another shot."
3,"Amanda B organized a UYE for Dim Sum here today.  They do Dim Sum from a menu instead of carts and it works really well.  They also have a picture menu to look at with many of the items on it so folks like me can have a better idea what to order just by picking the picture of stuff they liked on a prior trip.  We were pretty much the only folks there for quite a while and we had the full attention of the staff.  Not all of the staff is fluent in English but I can only recall that being a problem with the tea.  I liked my choices a bit better this time, experience helps, and Marian H was helping me with sauce pairings as there were several to choose from.

I almost gave them a 4 but for the restroom.  The fixtures had a lot of corrosion around them and in general the restroom showed a lot of wear.  I flushed the urinal and was washing my hands and it seemed like the running water was very loud, I looked over at the urinal and the valve had stuck and the place was indeed flooded.  I beat on the valve with my fist until it rocked back but by that time the floor was quite deep in water.  I mentioned it to the hostess and they had someone in there with a mop quickly.

I would definitely go back here again."
4,"My husband and I ventured up to BLT Steak at Camelback Inn on Friday evening to celebrate our third wedding anniversary, which was two days earlier. We sat inside and our corner table gave us a perfect view of Camelback Mountain at night. 

Our waiter was super nice and did a great job of suggesting items and answering questions when we had them. There was a seperate server who kept our water glasses full all night - we couldnt take more than two sips without having them refilled it seemed like. My only negative about our waiter was that when it was time for a new glass of wine for me, he didnt check with me first to see if I wanted another glass of the same wine. I think we all know the common saying about assuming things...

On to the food...heres what we sampled:

Popovers - delicious. I was a bit skeptical about the butter and sea salt, especially since I dont like butter very much, but it was great! 

Caesar salad - good size and it was one of the best caesar salads I have had in awhile. 

Crabcake - my least favorite part of the meal. While it wasnt horrible, there was a bit too much celery for my taste and not enough crab meat.

Cowboy Ribeye - since it was 22 oz, I graciously told my husband that I would have some of it so he could order it. Now those that know me know that I dont eat red meat because I dont like the taste. But I sucked it up and had some...holy crap, I had a few bites and said, ""Wow, this is really good"". So that should say something about how good it was. However, my husband did think the outside was a tad too well done, although the meat itself was cooked perfectly. While he liked the ribeye, he did think his steak at SW Steakhouse in Las Vegas was better.

Mashed potatoes - is it possible to get divorced over mashed potatoes? I thought we were going to throw it down because one side of the potatoes was just not enough!! They were sooo creamy and delicious. 

Chocolate peanut butter mousse - we got our dessert for free since when I made the reservation I indicated we were celebrating our anniversary. The dessert was a nice way to end the meal, although the chocolate on top was just a touch too rich for my taste.

With tip, our bill came to $162 which we did not think was bad at all for as much as we ordered. Unfortunately we didnt get to sit on the patio or enjoy the view at sunset, but I guess that means well have to go back which isnt a bad thing at all!"
4,"luckily, ive only had to take my truck in for service once and had no issues with service or quality. it is always expensive to have something auto related repaired....wish i wouldve paid more attention during shop class in high school, but oh well...i cant be good at EVERYTHING.

friendly staff. they called a few times to make sure i wanted them to proceed with repairs and had my truck done in a few hours."
2,Well I just wasted 38 bucks....never again
4,"for those who like dirt track racing, this is a place to go. its a 3/8 mile oval clay dirt track that hosts the likes of imca modifieds, super stocks, pure stocks, sw modlites, bombers, dwarfs cars, sprints, late models. 

after the races, go into the pits to meet the drivers and get an up close look at the cars. its a good time hanging out. 

they have concessions, souvenir stand, offer free overnight camping on race nights for self contained campers only, as no services are available. 

theres something about the roar of the engines and the exhilaration of the race that keeps me going back. 

check out the website, www.canyonspeedwaypark.com for schedule, entrance fees, directions, etc. 

hope to see ya there!"
5,"What can I say...Maharaja Palace was my midday getaway while living out in Phoenix, and I miss it dearly.  I visit as often as I can (up to three times a year, traveling from Hawaii) and when I do, I am always astounded by the flavors and array of choices this buffet provides.  The tiki marsala happens to be my favorite dish and I find the staff to be accomodating and attentive, especially when ensuring Ive got enough naan to sop up my plates delightful curries.  I cant wait to return.  This is THE SPOT for Indian Food in the PHX Metro Area, hands down!"
5,"I have long been a fan of AJs and lucky for me, they didnt open a location on the West Side of town until after I moved back to California. If they had, I would have been more broke then I was as a single working mother.

The daughter and I stopped in before her hair appointment for some coffee and pastries and then I came back in once her hair was getting done. The first thing I did was order some iced tea from their coffee counter. It was absolutely delicious iced tea and very reasonably priced. I want that tea now, I think it was pineapple or something yummy. 

I perused around the store, picking up some Goldwater Salsa and a stuffed Cornish game hen to cook later in the day for my Grandma from the butcher counter. I was thrilled that they still had the stuffed fresh hens for the same price I used to pay $4.99. Something inflation hadnt touched.I also picked up some huge honey crisp apples (something again Grandma can afford but wont buy for herself) and a small bunch of flowers for her. 

Next time I am in town, I am going to hit up AJs right away for some iced tea!"
5,"WOW what can I say... our friends have eaten here for years and we finally got to eat at Don and Charlies for the first time in all the years that we have been coming to Spring Training.  

We had an excellent dinner i was in the mood for fish and had the Macademia crusted Halibut.... WONDERFUL!!!!! My hubby had the prime rib and finished off every last juicy bite... the scalloped potatoes were the BEST I have ever had at any restaurant.

Must make this one of our usual stops during our yearly visit to Az."
4,"I have heard about this place for couple years before I actually get to try it out. Their guacamole burger is my favorite, and the Peanut Butter Malt was just amazing!! First time I tried, I ended up getting another one to go. They also have corn beef sandwich on Thursday, which I havent get the chance to try yet. Only thing I dislike is that they close at 8 pm which is a bit too early for me."
5,"Favorite Pho in the phoenix area so far.  
Great, tender meat in my pho chin nam (#8).
I see they also have bun bo hue on the menu so Ill have to try that sometime soon.    
Nom nom.

Friendly staff.

See ya there!"
4,"I was one of a party of 13 for a birthday party on Saturday night.  Yep, I was odd man out again and in more ways than one as I will note in a bit.  We got started a bit after 7 and first we got our drinks and spent some time chatting and reading the menus.  Most of the folks there had been there several times before.  Everybody but me wanted pizza and wings so I ordered fettuccine Alfredo ($18.95) with salad and garlic knots.  I know its un American not to be a fan of pizza and wings.  Their antipasta arrived and I sipped on my beer.  Then the pizzas came, then the wings followed by my pasta.  Somehow my order got separated from the rest and I had to ask for my salad and bread which finally came last.  The side salad wasnt earth shattering but was solid and the garlic knots were nice warm pieces of bread.  The pasta was delicious.  I mentioned I was not a fan of pizza or wings but I was coerced in to trying both a pepperoni pizza slice and a couple of Giovanni wings.  Both were really good, the pizza was a thin  crisp in spots crust.  The wings had none of the heat I normally associate with wings.  I had to take some of the pasta and bread home with me.  After dinner there was warm Zepellies and the birthday girl got this huge ice cream/brownie/whipped cream thing which her husband and I finished most of.  If you followed along, you will note I ate a lot of different stuff and I paid for it for several hours afterward.

For a large party we got quite good service except for my salad arriving late.  I just had the one beer (25oz) but most of the women were there to get their drink on and amongst them had several different mixed drinks and with one exception (weak) all were done well.

This is a big sprawling place with 2 bars and more TVs than I have seen outside of Vegas.  The original space which is sort of set off from the rest of the area has pool tables and darts.  There is a good sized outdoor area too."
3,"Angela, the Nurse practitioner, was great.  baby had a gooky eye and we took her to this urgent care office to see if it was Pinkeye so it could be treated early on.  It was Friday and her regular Dr. was booked up.  Angela said there was no Pinkeye but she had pus in her ears and had a minor ear infection so she prescribed antibiotics, amoxicilon I think.  The only hitch was when the baby had her regular dr appointment the next week he said there was no infection so we were left to wonder who was right."
3,"Ive heard about this place being ""the best"" burger joint so i had to check it our for myself. My boyfriend and i went on a saturday afternoon and to my surprise most of the seats were taken, people were coming and going so my first thought was they must be good since they were so busy. Severs were really nice and prompt.

we both ordered their 1/3 lb arizona smashburger which has: habanero cheese, guacamole, lettuce, tomato, onion, chipolte mayo and fresh jalapenos on a chipotle bun, we also had an order of their smash fries.

first thought, the presentation of the burgers and fries looked great, after putting mustard and ketchup on it and TRIED to pick up the burger everything almost feel out. It was messy and greasy totally ruined the experience of enjoying the burger. It tasted like any other burger, nothing really special about it. Their fries however were amazing. 

on a scale of 1-10 i would give this place a 6 just for the food presentation. my boyfriend said he wouldnt go back but ill give it another try one day."
5,"*CASH AND CHECKS ONLY*
*OPEN 9 AM, 7 DAYS A WEEK*

Love this place. Took my daughter here a year ago to get her very FIRST haircut. We had Miss Tara, who provided us with a ""first haircut"" certificate and she also had these tiny quarter-size ziploc bags for my daughters very first strand of hair that she cut. The haircut was $15. Along with the haircut, Miss Tara styled it and put clips and glitter in her hair. My daughter LOVED it. 

The place itself was kid-friendly. Theres a little kitchen for the kids to play with while waiting for their haircut. There are 3 big kid chairs for older kids to get their haircut. And there are 2 car-styled chairs for the younger kids. 

I took my daughter for her SECOND haircut today. We had Miss Annette. She was great. Again, my daughter got her hair styled after her haircut and got glitter and flowers put into her hair. The haircut was $15. We also got a punchcard, where youre 9th haircut will be free. 

This place does walk-ins, but it is better to call and schedule an appointment since they dont have a specific opening/closing time. They take CASH ONLY so keep that in mind."
1,Have been in twice since my last review. Its a like a COMPLETELY new atmosphere!! And sorry to say this is not in a good way. Service was terrible and I was emberassed that I actually brought some new people with me to try it out. Just went for this saturdays last ufc fight! They were like natzis with the seating you have to have 75% of your party with you to get a seat even though my boys were parking and in the parking lot they gave our table away so after getting the tenth degree abou there seating rules we were finally sat all had to sit speraticly through out the bar. We shouldve just turned around right then but decided to stay... then on top of that we were sat next to some drunk beligerent people spilling and flirting with there server (wich you could tell made her uncomfotable) that table were continuosly getting over served beers. Since there was not one mgr in sight the little time we were one of my boys stepped in and there was almost a fight right then and there.. putting that aside our service was horrible some dude was our server and we went without seeing him for like 30 min and not so cold beers. At that point after one round of drinks we decided not to order food and the table next to us was gripeing about there food so that was another sign to get the F out of there so we paid (once the server got back) then bolted. I wasnt going to yelp anything BUT I just received my checking statement and the dude added 5 to his 3 dollar tip. I gave the guy 3 on $12 he was lucky to have even gotten that. Im going to find out the guys name and go to upper mgmt because this is not the first time ive heard of this happening there. With that said.. I WILL NEVER BE BACK HERE AGAIN! This place has gone down hill!! . DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE !! Very disappointed
4,I absolutely LOVE the food from The Pitic! The place does look rundown and it is a rough neighborhood.. however those are the best places to eat arent they? Food is made fresh to order and out of the 10 or so years I have been coming here the quality of food never changes. It is great for families and actually anyone looking for a great mexican meal. Their crunchy beef tacos are to die for :)
4,"My eyebrows definitely needed some love...Ive ignored them so long that theyre starting to resemble 2 fat caterpillars and Ill soon risk a uni-brow if something isnt done stat. 

Did you say FREE waxing? Im a sucker for free stuff. 

The center is very sterile - not only in a clean and sanitary way, but also void of any personality. Its a chain though and theyre trying to go for the European vibe so Ill let them off the hook. 

The gal who did my wax was really nice, wore surgeons gloves, and carefully applied this purple gooey wax to my face, waited for it to dry, then pulled it off. It hurt a lot less than regular wax, and the fact that it was purple made it just seem cooler all around. I walked out 15 minutes later with clean brows and an appointment for my next wax. Definitely a good find."
4,"My girlfriend and I were hungry and wanted to try something new, so we hopped on the netbook and fired up Yelp. We tried Crazy Jims, and boy was this a good pick. When we 1st rolled up to CJs my girl was like ""I dont know about this!!!"" I said ""lets just go in and take a look, if it is clean inside then lets try it"". Once inside the place was small but quaint and most important it was CLEAN. So I ordered a veggie pita and got the pasta salad as a side. The food was ready pretty fast and I had envisioned something like a sandwich that you pickup and eat but it was all laid out over my plate. The pita was very good and I give a big thumbs up to, the pasta salad was kinda plain. My girl has a greek salad and she liked it but wasnt too crazy about the dressing. I would definitely go back to Crazy Jims and eat. As a matter of fact anytime I am craving that veggie pita, your boy ""E"" will come to visit. 

ps. Our server was great also, friendly, fast and helpful."
4,"Great Pizza! Great food! Great service! Still, this place isnt perfect....

BE PREPARED TO WAIT! Alright, most people seem to know this going in (we did too). However, when you arrive at 7:00pm, and they say you wont be seated until 11:30pm, that doesnt mean you can put your name in and show up at 11...which we almost found out the hard way: **At 10:00pm they will do one last head count. If youre not in the vicinity, soooorrrrry!** Luckily we were calling in every hour for updates (which they recommend, btw). At 9:40pm we called and got the news that we better be there for the last head count (information we probably could have used earlier), and had to hurry on back from our meanderings downtown. At 10:00pm we were deemed worthy to stay on the list and wait another 45 minutes or so.

Service: the hostess knows she holds all the cards--sort of like the lady at the cash register for the Soup Nazi. However, a smile was all it took to get one back from her for me. Still, I can see how others might misconstrue her attitude as something less than cordial. Our server was great though! Very helpful and fun. He was as excited to serve us as we were to eat there. Good stuff!

The pizza is indeed great! But after waiting 4 hours, I was expecting the heavens to part and birds to sing and the ground to shake. Nope. Just made-from-scratch, meticulously-thought-out, high-quality pizza. A light and airy, smoky crust, a decent sauce and fresh mozzarella formed the basis of the Sonny Boy and Wise Guy pizzas that we tried. The quality and tastiness of the toppings were also apparent. We were impressed. This was absolutely great pizza--one of the best weve ever had. ...I just dont know if Ill hurry back to Pizzeria Bianco to wait that long again."
4,"You know how you poke fun at people who go to a steakhouse and they order something like chicken or seafood? Im one of those people, but this time I teamed my seafood with STEAK!

They had a prix fixe menu that carried over from their New Years Eve dinner, but I skipped over that...

I have to say, I loved my sirloin and 5 pieces of shrimp. Shrimp was done correctly - not rubbery or charred and *gasp* it was actually de-veined. I cant tell you how Ive gone to nicer restaurants and their shrimp wasnt de-veined. So that alone got a little happy dance from me.

Food was a bit on the salty side, but it didnt make me have a massive thirst craving when we left the restaurant. Server was friendly and knowledgeable, which was great!

Hubby ordered his prime rib, but they didnt have it blue which was the way he wanted it. Its all good, they still brought him out some of the rarest prime rib Ive seen in a long time...

For an appetizer we ordered bacon wrapped scallops. I am a firm believer of bacon makes everything good! and it did. The sauce that came with the dish was delicate and flavorful. The fresh rolls that came minutes before the entree was served were my favorite kind - light and fluffy on the inside while the outer layer had enough crunch that satisfied me, yet didnt make me feel like I was about to chip any teeth. ;)

I cant wait to go back and try some of their other dishes!"
4,"Went to Pho Avina (which I could easily recommend to anyone) a few weeks ago with my 2nd dad and he spies the Korean BBQ place (note their signage all says Korean BBQ and not Chuhgajib) and he grabs a menu and we make note to ourselves to check it out (of course, not until after I checked out the other reviews on Yelp)

So we head there for lunch today.

Now, I know this about Korean food...I ate kimchi made by the mother of one of my daughters friends and it was good. Beyond that, I know that when I flip on LPGA on television to watch the hottee Paula Creamer, some Korean chick is depriving her of a victory and I am none too pleased but it does appear that they understand food...but I digress.

Lunch specials $ 4.95 - OK...Im suspicious. Includes 3 pieces of california roll, salad, rice, vegetable and entree. Too cheap. 

We order gyoza and egg roll appetizers. Evidently gyoza in Korean restaurant is different than Chinese restaurant but is scrumptious nonetheless. Egg rolls more typical to my expectations and very tasty - Im optimistic. Tea is in big weird cup with no handle and waaay too hot to actually pick up but tea bag says Liptons...Im still suspicious.

Salad, underwhelming but I am impressed with silver chopsticks that work well for me.

Comes the lunch platter...
- California Rolls, AOK 
- big mound of white rice, perfect
- pickled vegables, tasty and interesting
- sweet/sour vegetables, tasty and interesting...wishing someone could tell me what it was I was eating but hey, its all good.
- meat (I had bbq pork but forget the name) mildly spiced, nice, a little dry but that may have been intentional...my knowledge of Korean clearly fails me here. 2nd dad got bbq beef and it was very tasty, not spicy, much more moist.

We left stuffed, happy amazed that lunch could be so good and so cheap.

Place was packed and its obvious why. Inexpensive, tasty, no disappointments and very clean.

Woman who ran the restaurant wears sneakers and reminded me of a track star because she handled a packed restaurant but hardly seemed to work up a sweat and handled a bunch of to go orders as well.

I have to say...49th Avenue and Thunderbird, two excellent Asian restaurants practically side by side and you cant go wrong at either place.

You can gorge yourself for $10 here. You could drink water and have a $6 lunch that puts a Big Mac to shame."
4,"the folks at national car rental were very accommodating and even helped me upgrade my rental at little cost to me.  if the deal was right, i would definitely use this company again when visiting Phoenix!"
4,"Honestly I would normally go to a specific lady to get my nails done but she rides solo and my friend wanted to get her nails done with me at the same time. 

So I went where my friend goes and I was pleasantly surprised. Not to be snobby but I have done the strip mall walk in nail salon and usually walk out disappointed. I was expecting the absolute worst to be honest. 

The girl who worked on me NAILED IT! Pun totally intended.

I got the gel because that is all they offer. I normally get Shellac but hey...I am a convert for now. I will let you know how the hold up over time. For now my nails are amazing. Not only do they look great but it was done in half the normal time. 

The reason I gave 4 stars and not 5. 

The place is a little on the not so new or super clean side. Its not dirty its just not 5 stars. They also do not provide you with the nail oil my regular nail lady gives me to keep my nails hydrated. The only other thing is the lack of color selection for gels. If you are feeling like you need that electric blue, neon yellow or emerald green (color of 2013) then you are out of luck. 

All in all I will probably be going here from now on unless I want a more trendy color other than Red. Walk right in and walk right out with great nails and zero guilt on how much you just spent. :)"
4,Home made fresh noodles.  Reminds me of San Francisco china town food.
3,"As Targets go this one is standard fare. That consistency is part of their brand recognition. However, as a part of the Up-Scale Desert Ridge Shopping Center, Id expect a bit more than a Standard Target. Dont they have some sort of a Flagship Target?

Also traffic and parking can be atrocious at Desert Ridge. I drive to Targets and WalMarts much further from my house because the round trip time is less when I dont have to negotiate the teen packed Desert Ridge lot. Probably safer too."
4,"Love this place. the atmosphere was rather chill and calm. We played Uno, and drank pretty darn good coffee! we had a lemon cookie, which was...JUST RIGHT!"
5,"Review #800  

I had to wait for a great place to feature for #800.  
Enter: Parent morning movies... in a theater that offers changing tables and dim lights in addition to their ultra nice seating, VIP rooms, 21+ beverages, good food service, incredibly friendly staff, and caramel popcorn.  Im in!!  Oh, and did I mention its a beautiful, clean theater, too?

WHO: All mommies, daddies, and other care-givers

WHAT:  Go see a movie with your lil one!

WHEN: Wednesday mornings and occasional featured nights. 

WHERE:  Listings for participating Ultra Star theaters are here... http://www.ultrastarmovies.com/parent_movie_morning.asp

HOW: Because Ultra Star theater is AWESOME.

WHY:  Because you deserve to get out and enjoy a movie... bonus that its a movie with Early-Bird prices of $5.75!

I wanna give a shout-out to the management, staff and... whoever thought of parent movie mornings to begin with.  It was nice to get out of the house with my lil one, to do something that I used to take for granted when I wasnt a parent. haha  And then to get there and have the theater so nicely set-up, complete with changing tables and dim lights... well that was amazing.  All of the care-givers there were relaxed, happy and able to enjoy a movie without worrying about missing a part if their lil one fussed.  We all had nothing but praises for your kid-friendly attitude and made plans to meet often.  

Thank-you Ultra Star Cinema for a new, great experience.  Its been a while since a place surprised me so much (in a good way)!  

See ya there!"
3,"Cibo is a really adorable place, but I cant say that I think it is extraordinary.  The atmosphere and ambiance is totally five star, but too much goes wrong after that to give it an overall five star.  

Food stuff:  Ive been twice and both times I liked it, but it wasnt love.  We got the bruscetta plate and I wasnt really thrilled.  The traditional tomato one was the most solid choice, the bean one was strange and soggy and I dont eat pig so I cant comment on the third one (though everyone else seemed to enjoy it). The pizzas are pretty decent except that they lay out the toppings in a weird way, for example, if you order the vegetarian rosa pizza, if you like zucchini, it is all chopped up on two slices and so on.  It doesnt really make sense to top a pizza in such a way, to me.  I prefer draft beer over bottled beer, and all they offer is bottled.  I did enjoy a couple glasses of the Rossi Cabernet Sauvignon which was a solid wine choice.

Service:  The host/ess was a pleasant person, and the time quoted was less than we actually had to wait so that rocked.  While waiting, we attempted to get a drink.  The bartender was cool about getting our drinks in a timely manner despite the fact that it was busy.  Our actual server was super attentive at first and then lost for a good chunk of time as well.  Too hit or miss.  

Cibo is an adorable spot with awesome ambiance but it isnt quite that awesome when it comes to food and service."
5,"This review is for the food only.  If you care about parking and what kind of extras they sell that arent food related youll have to check out another review.

I love LGO.  The food is absolutely top notch and I love how the menu has both traditional fare and a few things youve never heard of like their Venice Beach Burrito which is filled with scrambled eggs, tofu chorizo, spinach, and other goodies.  It comes with a side of salsa which also fantastic.  I eat breakfast here all the time and I have never been disappointed.  Also, if youre in a hurry grab one of their pre-made granola/yogurt/fruit parfaits, Yum!"
3,"For mall food this place is great. Love the pitas, rice, and yummy potatoes."
4,"After work one night, I had a rediculous craving for some Thai Curry, so I remembered driving past this place and always seeing cars parked out front.  So, I thought, lets go there!  Glad I did!  I was a little freaked out when I pulled up @ 7PM, and there were no cars in the parking lot.  Then again, it is in Sun City, so their dinner rush ends @ 6, so it made sense.  I ordered the Yellow Curry with Rice and the Fish Patty with Cucumber Chili sauce as an appetizer.  Everything was so flavorful!  I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a great Thai experience.  I did not give this a 5, only because I am still learning about Thai food."
4,"Horseback riding for an hour and a half, my @$$ hates me right now...but it was so much fun.  

The terrain varies from dusty paths to shallow streams and rocky roads.  Id consider myself a beginner as far as horse riding goes.  I dont count horse camp 20 years ago to count towards ""experience"".  But riding a horse is kinda like riding a bike.  Once you learn you dont forget how to do it, but every horse is different.

We had a successful ride, seeing wild horses, a roadrunner (yes, they do exist but look nothing like the cartoon one), bald eagles and their nest, roaming cattle and waded on horseback through shallow rivers and streams in the breathtaking desert.  I wanna move to Arizona!"
4,"Ask to sit outside, if you can! The patio is wide, clean, and fresh air goes great with a Grand Slam. Very kind manager working the day we called to see if we could bring our dog with us before we had to run off to her dog training. She said they dont normally allow pets out there, but since there was nobody outside, she would allow it unless someone complained. We got there, passed the pup over the gate, and had brinner like champs while watching the traffic. The manager came by to check on us and even brought out a bowl of water for Tatum. Like everyone says, its Dennys food... what do you expect? But I think the hospitality makes all the difference."
5,"I have been here many times, pretty much cant go wrong here. prices are good service is prompt and friendly."
4,"As a travel consultant for cre8adventures.com, we came away impressed. This is a moderately priced getaway of unquestionable value. For travelers seeking style in an in-town locale, this chic desert retreat may currently fall behind the Mondrian, but it easily surpasses Chaparral Suites next door. The staff is showing off its Kimpton training, and the service standards were very welcome. This hotel gets high marks on all fronts.

Taggia, the hotels new restaurant, is a stylish Italian venue with a unique Ligurian-anchored menu that features fresh seafood and creative traditionally inspired dishes. A large kiva-style fireplace warms the alfresco section, and waterfalls surround it.

The only downside is that Kimpton hasnt fully finished up on the room makeovers yet. Compared with Kimptons usual attention to room furnishings and design, these digs are mild-mannered. The older patterned carpeting was disappointing.

Still Kimpton has done an admirable and feverish job at making over this property. Kudos."
5,"being that im fully vietnamese and my mom has made all types vietnamese dishes ever since i was a kid, i have quite the tastebuds for authentic vietnamese food. also, growing up in so cal there are a lot more restaurants to choose from. 

for arizona, this place is probably one of the best authentic vietnamese restaurants in town. i always get their pho ap chao....even the owner knows this when i step foot in the door. :) their pho is really great..the broth is good, the beef is good, the noodles are good. everything is like it should be. their spring rolls are pretty decent. what i really like is it doesnt pretend to be something its not. its a hole in the wall place, but most good and REAL vietnamese places are. the food is great and the service is quick."
3,"My boyfriend and I tried this place out last Saturday. Our total was $24 for 2 burgers, 2 fries, 2 beverages. Not bad for a lunch in Scottsdale. We found the burgers to be just OK tasting. Nothin special to lure us back anytime soon. I was satisfied with portions for $. I think people are used to ridiculous huge meals like the ones served at cheesecake factory which are big enough to feed a family of horses so when they see a normal single portion they feel underwhelmed/cheated. I found the restaurant to be clean and nice enough to sit & enjoy the burger & kill some time before our movie started."
3,"My wife and i stayed there for our anniversary and had a great time.  little dissappointed in the cottage we stayed in.  i know the place is old but you have to update and remodel every once in awhile (century).  I want to give 4 stars but i also think that the price was a little steep for a summer rate.  Now, i know that i should expect to pay alot for the biltmore but i am not the ritzy type of person.  I am sure my wife would give it 5 stars."
2,"This is not that great of a place.  Its very upscale but the folks behind the sushi bar dont really seem to know what they are doing.  It took forever to get a beer and a sake here.  The worst part was the sashimi yellowtail.  It looked like it was purple on the edges.  If you want to play it safe and get a tuna roll, it will be safeway quality but nothing too special.  This place is more about atmosphere and where to eat if you have a glittery scottsdale shirt you need to show off."
1,"I do enjoy a good bowl of Pho.   This was -not- a good bowl of pho.

grey chicken meat., off tasting broth, old bean sprouts, 1 piece of a jalepeno pepper... dingy insides.  Weird looks from the server.  I dont think Ill be back.  Not much else I can say"
5,"This has got to be the best barber shop Ive ever been to in my 38 years on this planet.  I was always getting terrible haircuts at places like Great Clips and Hair Cuttery (when I lived in Virginia Beach), and I just assumed it was because I naturally had jacked-up hair.  After getting my first haircut from Israel (the barber, not the country), I know Id have a hard time looking elsewhere.  I dont know if these dudes were ever in the military, but their attention to detail is top notch."
3,"While Scottsdales Jackrabbit Supper Club is Britney Spears-approved -- the pop singer made the rounds last December when she reportedly made out with Arizona Cardinals hottie Matt Leinart -- its a little too clubby for my taste. The music is usually loud, making it hard to carry on a conversation and nearly everyone looks like they stepped out of the pages of a fashion magazine. Oh, and be prepared to throw down more than the norm for drinks -- martinis are $13! If all of this isnt scaring you away, youll probably have a good time. And the best part? The bar offers hourly burlesque-style performances from the clubs saucy dancers."
4,"Stopped by for a quick bite on a Saturday afternoon. Did not realize that the place had just opened (or at it appeared that way). Quite crowded with patrons, a bubble machine, and a DJ. 

It was bit loud with all the commotion, but still within reason. The menu is compact, but offered all the usual suspects. I went for the Pulled Pork sandwich with a side of cole slaw. I dumped the cole slaw on top of the pork and went to town on the sandwich. Meat was moist and smoky. The sauce had a hint of of kick. Very tasty.

The service was a bit slow, but the place was pretty much full up so I expected it to take a bit of time.

Good joint. Would return."
4,This place is so good. I love the big sandwhiches and the soups are so delicious. The only complaint I have is that I went twice and I unfortunately got hair and a fingernail clipping in my soup in two different times I went.
5,"Lets face it, junk is the antithesis of glamorous.  When youve got a big pile of crap you need hauled away, any guy with a truck will do, right?

WRONG.  You want someone that will be on time, is willing to clean up the area where the junk is after theyve picked everything up, is polite and fluent in English, thinks of value-added services like emptying your trash bin, and represents a local business that you can patronize.

Junk Guys ticked all these boxes for me.  THe guys were great and helped me out when I needed some items hauled away from a house that I had sold.  Id highly recommend them over an unknown entity or a big corporate junk removal company.  So go get your crap hauled away by the Junk Guys - youll thank me!"
5,"Im completely impressed by The Mission and I cant wait to go back and try more of their amazing food.  

My husband and I chose The Mission for our 8th Anniversary dinner and had a wonderful time - the staff is extraordinarily knowledgeable and very warm & welcoming.  Yelp steered us in the right direction as per usual, so we split the cheese plate with manchego to start, the pork shoulder tacos for dinner and split a pumpkin bread pudding for dessert.  Everything was expertly prepared and delicious.  The bread pudding was EASILY the best Ive ever had.  We usually dont order desserts and Im glad we did, because I cant stop thinking about how amazing this was.  

My husband had an Avocado Margarita and an Estrella beer (Awesome that they have this available - and it was even served in an Estrella glass - impressive).  Since Im pregnant, I asked if the bartender could make me a virgin version of their ""Sophia Loren"" with fresh strawberries & mint - score!  It was delicious and Ill certainly be back to try it with the proper amount of booze :)
  
Lastly, how amazing is that Himalayan Salt Brick wall????  I NEED this in my house!"
4,"I grew up at Word of Grace (now City of Grace). Way before the new buildings and it just the small little church. I love Pastor Gary. I would give him 5 stars. We moved but I had always considered this my home church. When we moved back to AZ I started again and was really disappointed with the young adults ministry and praise and worship. I left when I wasnt getting anything out of it and not much longer did they join with City Church. I think they are struggling but I have hope for them. Pastor Terry is the new head pastor and he has the Joel Osteen vibe, which isnt for me, but he is very nice. 

They are non- denominational and love their congregation enough to handle sins or situations other churches dont want to touch in fear of being labeled as haters or what not. I hope that anyone who attends will understand their views do not come from hate. It makes me sad that the other reviewer had such a negative experience and I dont doubt that she wasnt treated with kindess as every church seems to have those rude people. I am not sure what she means by closed-minded but I know there are people like that at every church. I hope others do not have that experience and I hope the church can work on that as a whole. people need to feel welcome and accepted as they are. 

They are also awesome with the community- homeless outreaches, drug addiction help, and so many things I cannot begin to list. If you ever want to help your community City of Grace would be a great place to get ideas of where/how you can help. 

 If pastor Terry isnt for you I would recommend Cornerstone Chandler(my home church) or Central Christian. They are not closed-minded but they also wont ignore sins that are major issues. IE divorce, porn, sex, sexuality, infedility, etc.  Good luck on finding your home church!!"
3,Nice place...Need more restaurants..! Pretty huge airport...so long walks..!
4,"They must have renovated this place in the last year. It is now spacious and airy and there is no longer the dreaded ""hover over a table to get a seat"" necessity.  It now reminds me much more of the dreaded ""Panera Bread"" chain in California, but the food is still much better and has much less of a ""mass produced"" feeling and taste.

The service (management, staff etc) were extremely attentive and responsive to requests as well as keeping the place extremely well clean and cleared.

I love carbs...Carbs with carbs and a side of carbs.  They serve warm syrup with their pancakes (yum!) and their bread is just amazing.  

The ""side of pancakes"" is plenty big for a meal and they are always consistent, fluffy, and tasty.  

They offer both a dark roast and a house roast for coffee and all the powdery loveliness (cinnamon, nutmeg, cocoa) to top it off just right.

Today, before returning to the land of freeways and smog and eternal sunshine(well, the other land of that anyway) we enjoyed their peppermint hot chocolate. I would highly recommend that you run on it and have this frothy goodness before the holiday season ends!"
5,"Im usually not a big buffet fan, but this place changed my mind!  Its very clean, good service, lots and lots of amazing dishes, AND really good sushi!  Weekend lunch was $14.99, but during the week its $11.99. Well worth every penny. One more comment, this isnt the kind of buffet where ""shifty people"" go. The kind where you need to Purell your hands and arms when you get back to the table : )"
5,"Came for the beer, stayed for the scenery."
5,"I love this place. Im mostly here at dinner time to pick up my favorite roasted turkey artichoke panini and sometimes salad and soup as well! The staff is super friendly and recognize when my boyfriend and I show up, maybe because he can never leave without getting a dozen of their amazing cookies! The manager Kaylee is fabulous, she makes us feel right at home and is never unsatisfactory. They may have a smaller parking lot but I guess I have always had good luck with finding a spot! I know I will continue to come back for more."
5,Friendly group. Great specials....Try THE BASIC breakfast. Its more than enough.
4,"Big craft beer selection, in bottles and on tap. Not for those who go to a bar looking for mixed drinks (dont think they even sell liquor) or people who want to drink bud light. Youre likely to find something you like, even if youre a picky beer drinker, you just might have a hard time narrowing down from the huge selection. The coolest thing about his place is the liquor store style fridges, filled with individually and six pack priced beers. You can just walk up to the fridges, pull out what you want and either drink it there or take it home. Definitely a unique place. They also sell food, which we didnt have, but was available. Next to food poses outside, and other bars and clubs."
5,"Pita Jungle can do NO WRONG in my eyes! 

The food has always been amazing! I have been going here for 10 years or so and have never left displeased.  Also they are a home spun local business, which always makes me happy! 

Yes, they do have hipper then thou hipster working there, but those hipsters can sure make a mean hummus! 

I have many favorites which is starting to make it hard when I go there, because I want them all! Pita Jungles portions are always so generous that I have never even finished what I ordered. 

My new fav is the Lentil Fetoosh Salad, the mix of the lentils and rice with the caramelized onions over the fresh mixed greens with that lemon vinaigrette is WHOA! Its incredibly filling, split it with 2 or 4 friends, seriously! 

Another fav is off the starters section, but its so much food that I never finish! The lavosh pita crisp! Its like a fancy spicy supped up cheese crisp! 

Thank You Pita Jungle for bringing bomb diggity food to the valley!"
1,I am a huge fan of Chipotle but I will never come back to this location. The staff looks miserable and are SLOW. The cashier decided she would rather clean tables then ring people up so we waited for her to come back. Most of the tables were already clean so she could of waited to clean. The rice was crunchy like it wasnt cooked all the way and the steak was really chewy. Never again!
5,"The best gyro you will have in Arizona...
or maybe anywhere.

Love the grocery selection.
Everyone there is really nice.
And you can buy a BUCKET of dates for like $6."
4,"The first time was so good, we had to come back!  The Peach Creme Brulee pancakes wowed my partner both times... something totally addicting about the crunchy edges.  Their Daily Dose Hash is a delicious blend of sweet potatoes and onions, with so much more, making me wish I had the recipe.  The omelets are good, its just that I want them to be better, to the point where I have to have them again.  Both the Caprese omelet and the Bacon omelet tasted like the listed ingredients were put into the omelet.  That is different from making the combination of ingredients to a whole delicious oneness.   Im going to go for the French Toast next time.  The service the first time was a 10+ out of 10, with the 7am server being very friendly, very helpful and made the whole experience even better.  This past Weds morning, it was good, nice, perfect service and friendly... about a 9.  I really like this place and Im going to go back a few more times to find the best dish."
5,"Wow! I was in town on a week long business trip and the one thing I look forward to most when I travel are the meals. Cafe Monarch was a highlight of my trip. As soon as I walked through the door I felt cozy and right at home. Chef Chris asked me what I preferred out of a few selections and I went with the lamb chops and spinach.  Usually Im pretty picky about lamb and always inquire about prep but I left myself in his hands.  Chef Chris served me a perfectly cooked thyme rubbed lamb with a wonderful citrus sauce.  Spinach was prepared with garlic and a hint of mint which complemented the lamb perfectly.  Simple, fresh, delicious...

Just remember to bring cash"
5,Great service
5,Love this place! Amazing Happy Hour Specials!!
3,"I love the layout of this outdoor bar. However, the price of drinks here and the lack of well options is a huge turn off. Its also going to be interesting to see if people are into the idea of an outdoor ""dance club"" once summer comes back around. 

The view is awesome. Im always up for supporting independent downtown businesses, this place just needs to make some changes to make me want to come back."
1,"Long wait for food, waitresses that dont know what theyre doing, grumpy hosts, and crappy food that keeps us off the lake for 2 hours is not somewhere I plan on going ever again."
4,"Went in midweek for lunch with a few guys from work. Place was quiet, easy to get seats. Staff were super friendly and efficient. 
Some of the best wings I have ever had... Try the boneless wings, hot, and ""Finished on the grill""... AWESOME!!! Also highly recommend the patty melt on marbled rye with sweet potato fries."
4,"After browsing at the Bookmans next door, we were feeling hungry and were tempted by the notion of tasty burritos.  We ended up getting non-burrito meals, but were fully satisfied with our entrees.  The green chile plate was filled with perfectly cooked pork with a spicy tomatillo sauce that went well with the pork.  The horchata tasted freshly made and was very refreshing and light.  Overall, I think Big Burrito is a good option for those that want a filling meal without breaking your wallet."
5,"Really?  Because it doesnt get any better than this.  For what it is and for what its worth this place is truly unique.  A slight step up from a hole in the wall type of place, this quaint spot serves up good, tasty, and satisfying food hot from the kitchen.

What is a pasty?

A pastys history can be associated with the tin miners in England.  The story goes that these miners were covered head to toe in dust and other nasty stuff and would eat these calzone like dishes as a means to have nourishment without the need to return to the surface.  Supposedly, the miners were able to eat the pastry like food by holding onto the ""handles"" and when done, discard the tainted remains into the mine thereby appeasing the spirits that haunted the mines.

At the Cornish Pasty Co. I can first hand recommend the Chicken Pesto.  Very good flavoring and filling.  Or you can go with the more traditional route with beef, potatoes, and swede.  The sauces that come with your pasty are there to accent the flavors and are highly recommend to try as well.

Pros
* Good food
* Originality
* Portions
* Customer service
* Coat hooks at the bar

Cons
* Small interior"
4,"Mmmmm, Mmmmmm, Great food.  The popcorn shrimp here are to die for-they leave a wonderful lasting impression.  So does their desert plate...The service was wonderful and quick and attending to us.  Also, we had been lounging at the pool all day and were not looking so sharp but they didnt seem to have a dress code or anything as they were more than welcoming.  It is a bit pricey but im not sure you can expect anything less when going to a W Hotel.  I recommend this place to anyone who wants a more chic sushi experience, cool atmosphere, doesnt mind paying the extra dollar and enjoys tasty food."
4,"I almost dont even want to write a review for this place. Its so near and dear to my heart and I basically live here that I just dont know how to NOT write a novel of a review for this place. So Ill attempt to bullet point my feelings on the joint:

A. Friday Happy Hour - need I say more? Pretty sure all the homies would agree that weve spent thousands of dollars here over the years. Youre welcome Lodge. 
B. Cheese Curds - FRIED cheese balls and ranch. nuff said. 
C. Best server ever, my homeboy Michael (you guys need to give him a raise. I havent seen him around much lately and Im pretty sure thats why Ive been at Kellys more recently)
D. Black-outs
D+. I have a scar on my left knee where I ate shit playing cornhole. How do you eat shit playing cornhole? No clue. Probably because of the above point listed above. 
E. Lodge stimulus package - $6 for a can of PBR, a shot of nasty ass whisky, and a cigarette. BEST DEAL IN TOWN. Pretty sure the ex got nice and hammered a few times off this lil package - great deal ladies. Get your man sloshed and then take advantage of him. Always a good idea. 

The only reason why theres not 5 stars is sometimes when you sit on the patio, it takes about a year for a server to come around. Best bet it to hunt one of them down and start a tab that way. 

Oh The Lodge. Such great memories here...and most of them are just hazy bits and pieces."
4,"Simply put, The Grind provided one of the top five burgers Ive ever eaten in my life. The peppercorn burger was piled high with toppings and as amazingly flavorful as Id been told to expect. The service was friendly, attentive, and fast. The food was juicy, flavorful, and reasonably priced. Their hot wings were flavorful and the bread pudding made a grand end to the meal.

Though my initial order was brought out slightly off (with cheese despite my request) they cooked up a replacement in under 5 minutes and had it out to the table in no time. Similarly, when a friends drink was a bit too bitter for her taste the bartender mixed up a second version more to her liking, but did not charge her any additional fee.

The only downside: I found the fries a tad unimpressive and overpriced. Ah well, not the reason I came here. 

If youre near this end of Phoenix Id highly reccomend giving The Grind a shot."
5,"I cant describe to you how amazing these gourmet adult hot pockets taste! They literally MELT in your mouth- a few of my favorites are the Cajun Chicken, Dill Salmon, and the Stilton & Steak---Bon Appetit everyone! And dont forget about the all day everyday-$3 car bombs(you cant beat that price) their happy hour is amazing, too!"
4,Excellent selection of unusual but delicious pizzas.  my favorite so far include prosciutto pizza and the lamb pizza
2,"The rap on Starbucks is that they ""over-roast"" or ""incinerate"" their beans.

And I think that might be right...sometimes at Starbucks, it seems like Im drinking something brewed from charcoal briquettes...it doesnt taste good:(

Now, I will tell you that I am really no connoisseur of coffees...I like coffee, you know...a good dark roast, made with freshly roasted beans:)

But the beans dont have to come from a specific plant , grown on the southern side of a special hill in Columbia and then eaten and pooped out by a badger of some sort.

No, I just want a decent cup of coffee at a decent price:)

Why cant Starbucks do that?

I occasionally need to meet someone for business, and Starbucks comes up as meeting place (and I understand that...they are almost annoyingly ubiquitous:)

I have sat at a cafe table on a street corner in San Francisco, having a cup of coffee at a Starbucks...looking at the Starbucks across the street...Lewis Black calls it ""the place where space and time folds in on itself""...I say ""why build the Hadron Super Collider to open a black hole?""...Starbucks did it a decade ago with a combination of charred coffee beans and vats of money to open a Starbucks for every adult in the United States:)

In and of itself, thats no reason for a 2 star review...Gordon Gecko said it best...""Greed is Good!"" and Starbucks exemplifies that credo...they are a generally very successful corporation grown up from the Bay area defectors from Peets Coffee...I have no problem with success:)

No, my gripe with Starbucks is that they seem to be all about the marketing and not about the product...their coffee is crap:) So is most of the stuff they serve...its second or third rate, at best.

And just because its convenient doesnt mean we all need to stop in.

There is better coffee and better tea and better everything around...at much better prices...its worth looking for another meeting spot:)"
4,"Being a total Asian bobaface in a generally boba-deficient state, I adore this joint.  The chocolate mint smoothie is always on my mind if Im in the Tempe area or passing through on my way north.  I dig my boba firm and chewy, so I always ask for the drink to be made extra icy to chill the little pelotas to ideal suppleness.  Eba has a pretty large menu and will gladly do flavor combinations.  They use the proper plastic seal on the tops of the cups so you can shake the living daylights out of the drink (as one should).  

Also, Eba has free wi-fi and is close to the airport; its our favorite pre-flight stop to do a final check of email."
5,"Everything here is awesome! I love the Kung Pao shrimp and the Hong Kong soup which has wontons and and egg noodles they make in house. The soup they bring out before your meal is delicious as well. Everything tastes made to order, always fresh never greasy, and is presented beautifully. The staff is very friendly and attentive. Definitely try this place! Its a regular lunch spot for my office. They also have great lunch specials. :)"
5,"Im going to be an uptight stickler here, and only review the pizzeria portion of LGO since the grocery part can be done under as a separate business. I hope others follow suit. Sorry, Im super nerdy about this stuff.

Anyways, the sourdough crust is my favorite pizza crust in all the land. I love the flavor and how its always glistening with oil when it comes to the table. The toppings are really special here. If you even remotely like avocado, get their avocado pizza. The lemon zest puts it over the top. The corn with goat cheese is my next favorite. The only one that I havent liked is the the rocket man. It tasted fine, but the heavy toppings were too much for the thin crust.

We also had the fortune of trying their grilled artichoke appetizer one evening. I couldnt get enough of it! Its not on the menu (seasonal item Im sure), but we asked about it when we saw plates of it go by.

Extra bonus points for the large selection of cheap pizza wines. Any time I can get a decent bottle at a restaurant for under $20, Im a happy camper."
4,"Finally, a pizza place that delivers to the Grayhawk area. Seriously, when I moved here over the summer and was unpacking I was shocked to learn that no one except Dominos delivers to Grayhawk. At all. Now, on my honeymoon in October I was in Giza, Egypt and saw that, if you stand with the Sphinx facing your back, you can see a Pizza Hut. Yes, that is correct, you can get pizza delivered to the Great Pyramids and Sphinx, but not to Grayhawk. 

But, now we have Zpizza, and it is good. The pizzas range from the usual to more inventive things, such as the Casablanca, which has artichokes. They also feature organic and healthy selections, such as soy or low fat cheese and wheat or gluten free crust. They salads are also fresh and tasty and, while I have not tried them, they also serve sandwiches.

Overall, a good pie, wide selection and it delivers!"
5,"Now that I have tried all the main bubble tea/boba places in the Valley, I can say that this place is the best and most consistent. It therefore deserves five stars!"
2,"I dont often review places on Yelp because of the time commitment and because usually I am just looking for a good bite to eat. This time, though I feel I should if not to balance the ridiculous number of 4 and 5 stars bouncing around for this place.
The food was decent, and the atmosphere OK but seriously, how can this place cost as much as it does ($60+ for two people eating light)?? And how are people fawning all over it? I dont like to complain about a good meal, and indeed this meal was good but I cant seem to justify the cost as compared to most any other place I have tried in Phoenix that would be considered in St. Francis class. 

I ordered a Hearts of Romaine Salad and a bowl of cauliflower soup. I shared a plate of the baked goat cheese with my guest. Not one of these dishes would have tasted much different had I made them myself from ingredients at the Public Market. Indeed, I have had cauliflower soup at the market that tasted just as good for a fraction of the price.

The service was good, I will say, and for that I would offer a higher rating. But the general ambiance of pretension was more than I could justify, again for a meal I feel like I have had 100 times before. 

In the end I guess I would say if they would knock about $10 off of each plate, and cut some of the pretentious attitude, I would probably be offering a much  better review. 

I am not planning a return anytime soon."
4,I live in north Phoenix and believe me there needs to be a lot more quality dining out here. This is a gem. The atmosphere is tops. The food is consistent. The management actually cares. Its just a cool place all the way around! A lot of corporate establishments seem to yank popular things off the menu cause its just not trendy anymore. Every single thing I have had at this place was delicious! Not one other restaurant has pulled that off. A place you can actually count on for a good evening. High five to the Yard house!
5,"Hnnngffff their signature spinach pizza
Its the only thing Ive ever ordered there
And it alone warrants 5 stars."
5,"A few years ago my husband bought me a gift certificate for this spa. Oh my god - it was the most beautiful spa I had ever went to! I had a facial and a massage. In addition to that - I got unlimited day usage of their spa stuff! They had a beautiful locker room that had a sauna and jacuzzi in it. An secluded area where you could lay outside - naked! They also had a huge pool out behind the spa where you could just layout and be lazy. Oh- also they had some sitting rooms with magazines, fire places -oh my goodness. It was awesome! AND - the prices werent that high compared to other spas in the valley. Check it out if you can!"
5,Fantastic donuts! Great selection! Coffee was definitely above average!
5,"Saw this place on Triple D so I decided to give her try. My expectations were high and when I arrived I was shocked that on a Thursday morning the line was extra extra long. Had to wait patiently which when it comes to food I dont like. 

But needless to say the wait was worth it because when I got in there I was served quickly. I ordered the pork chop, eggs, and hash browns.  The pork chop there is fabulous and the toast and home made grape jelly was good. 

I would recommend this place for breakfast to anyone who is in the downtown area of Phoenix. Make sure to try the bacon too."
4,"Right after I wrote my first review of this place, a groupon deal popped up that would let me try the pizza. I jumped right on it and used it today for lunch. 

We came in about 3pm and it was pretty crowded. The pizza oven was going, and there were lots of people sitting around eating gelato. A lot more crowded than the last time we came in, thats for sure. We ordered lunch, I got the marinara pizza and my husband ordered the chopped salad. The wait time for our lunch was pretty minimal. A little over five minutes. My pizza came out first and it was pretty delicious. The crust was thin, with just the right amount of fluffy in the edges, and with a nice char on the bottom from the pizza oven. The sauce was tangy and had a nice array of spices in it. It was also covered in garlic and fresh basil leaves. I really enjoyed this pizza. My husbands salad was lettuce, chopped carrots, cucumbers, roasted corn, cherry tomatoes, parm, all in a very tasty vinaigrette on top of a piece of flat bread. His salad was also very delicious. Our coupon covered our whole meal plus two small scoops of gelato, but the prices of our lunches was pretty reasonable. I would come back here to eat the food again.

The gelato on the other hand, is still not my favorite. I had strawberry today and didnt finish it again. I dont know what it is about the gelato here, but I am just not crazy about it. Hence the four stars. The pizza and salads are great though. Come try those."
2,"Writing my 7/29/11 review prompted me to return to this establishment for a manicure. I got there at 9am, but unfortunately the sign on the door states they dont open until 10am. So I ran a few errands and returned at 10am. There was no one in the store and all the lights were out. Again, it is already over 100 degrees outside by 10am. I decided I didnt need a manicure that bad and left."
1,The Management Group at this location need to make a better effort to control the number of people jumping theaters.  My experience at this theater was one of the worst that I have ever had.  I will never go back to that theater again.  I felt that it was nothing but a complete money grab.
3,"Food was tasty. I ordered the veggie combo, and was a little disappointed that it didnt come with more of a variety of things, especially for $12. BUT what it did come with was good."
5,"Beautiful hotel, great pool, nice restaurants, fantastic service, fabulous place to stay."
1,"I eat a lot of Asian food (of different sorts).  Asian is actually my go-to cuisine since I have a lot of food allergies.  This place deserves a thumbs-down, unless you love Americanized Asian.  The food was bland, breaded and just not worth any money.  Next time Im in Phoenix, I definitely wont eat here."
5,"What an unbelievable night we had at Mastros City Hall Steakhouse. Everything we ate was top notch, the atmosphere is fun, and the service is spectacular. How many steakhouses play Jim Croce, Beatles, and Beach Boys? Its a very welcome change.

Its dark, its sexy, and its probably the best steakhouse in Arizona. 

The seafood tower featured totally fresh and delicious oysters, crab legs, claws, and huge shrimp. My Kansas City Strip was out of this world and probably the best piece of meat Ive had all year. Gorgonzola mac & cheese and sauteed mushrooms were real winners as well. Im not a dessert person, but the warm butter cake should be illegal its so good. I was stuffed already when it came to the table, and then I ate all of it. 

The only hiccup all night was our seafood tower was short a shrimp, and when I told the waiter dont worry about it he said ok, and then proceeded to bring us a fourth shrimp on its own bed of ice. It was a really top notch recovery. This place is absolutely amazing."
5,So yummy!  I got the low calorie yogurt with all kinds of yummy fruit in it & didnt even feel guilty.  Such a fun place to go with friends or as a nice dessert after dinner. I cant wait to go again!
5,"Delicious barbecue, we had 4 meats platter that we split with three people.  The pulled chicken is amazing, the brisket tender and juicy, the ribs succulent and flavorful, best barbecue around.  The sides were delicious as well, mac & cheese was great, mashed potatoes did not disappoint, ranch beans arent anything special but they tasted good.  

Service was great, waiter was attentive to our needs and accommodated a last minute switch after already putting in the order. Atmosphere is good, not too noisy/quiet, the lighting could be improved though, a single bulb above the table barely allows you to see what you are eating, though the food wasnt there long enough to be seen:)

Highly recommended to someone looking for great barbecue ribs, chicken, brisket, etc."
2,"Stopped by one night late, only one guy working, probably the manager/owner based on him being on the phone and looking like he wanted to gtfo dodge attitude and not wearing anything quiznos related like most workers do... 

Food... subpar... its a chain... its hard to fuck up... but he did. There was no care in the making of the sub... I pretty much watched him throw it together, run it through the toaster tossed some lettuce on and wrap it up...

I had chips in my hand... wanted a meal... he didnt ask and just rang it up w/o the drink... I asked what size cup to grab and he said ""oh you wanted a drink?""  Of course I wanted a fucking drink... I just stared at him like wtf man?  Told him to keep his drink cause hed have to re run my card...  

srsly its a chain that gives you all the stuff and training to make a sandwich like the other 1000s of quiznos around the country... and you cant do it. If you hate customer service dont buy a franchise sandwich shop.

Two stars... lucky it isnt one. Im out"
5,"What a place!  I recently hosted a 25-person family party there, and both the food and service were impeccable.  The staff were all very friendly and accommodating, even with the dozen children we had in the group.  Leslie was the manager and she paid attention to every last detail, helping me to plan the menu and gauge food quantities for that many people.  The restaurant itself was spotless, from the outside patio down to the restrooms.  Thanks for making our family event such a wonderful success.  Everyone left full and happy.  We will definitely be back!!"
2,"Ive only been here once, and for good reason. To put it nicely, the service was seriously lacking. I walked in and nothing. They didnt ask if I needed help looking for something, greet me, or even acknowledge me until I was about to pay. I guess the magazine the cashier was reading was VERY important. Ive been to several comic book stores and I dont need someone to hold my hand, I would just like common courtesy. On the positive it was a organized place and the selection was pretty good."
1,"I had high hopes for this place, and it is really too bad because I love to support the Phoenix area restaurants, especially a Caribbean one and I had already been to the adjoining Rum Bar and loved the drinks, but the food was bad.  It was not only bad, but by all means avoid the daily market catch.  It was not fresh at all!  Very over priced!  For nearly $25 for a simple white fish they could have at least taken the bones out of the thing.  It tasted like it had been sitting around all day (or two) in its own juices, and when I let the waiter/bartender know he just ignored it and then ignored us until we left.  I will never be back for the food.  The Rum flights are worth a trip there, but that is it."
4,"Pros:
1.  Excellent service.  Hell, its damned right impeccable.  
2.  Superclean and comfortable rooms.
3.  Excellent amenities and top notch spa.

Cons.
1.  J-Dubbs a little spendy on the cocktail side.
2.  KEEP THE POOL BAR OPEN LATER! MY GOD!!!  Id like to watch the sun set with a cocktail, rather than have the sidewalk rolled up around 5."
5,"This place is the best! They stopped doing tacos, but if your lucky! they do have them call before you go! Some outside seating (picnic tables) no seating inside. Take away only.They also have another location!!! Yea! In a strip mall on 51 ave & orangewood. They do serve ""tacos"" at this location!"
4,"Like Red Robin, Carrabas is my go-to Italian joint that I know I wont be disappointed in.  

I love their bread and the yummy oil/herbs that go with it.  I do ask for butter as well, but they always seem to bring out this frozen ball of butter.  I dont get that.

The best dish they have is their Pollo Rosa Maria.  It consists of two chicken breasts, stuff with fontina cheese and covered with a huge helping of sauteed mushrooms.  Make sure to get it with fettuccine alfredo.  Its a must!... if you dont like pasta, I dont know what to tel ya.  The combo of the two is a match made in heaven.

They have great salads and their own special house dressing.  Heads up on your ranch lovers.  they do not have ranch dressing.

As for their deserts, Im not much of a fan until they have their quarterly creme brulet.

Good food!"
5,I love love this store!! Their reduced fat chicken salad and pasedena salads are to die for. The prepackaged frozen meals are also yummy! My daughter loves their yogurt and premade pasta meals. Their clif bars are 1/2 the price as supermarkets!! The employees are extremely nice and helpful. I would SO recommend this store to any and every one!!
5,"San Felipes Cantina will always have a special place in my heart. Ive been coming here since it opened, and I havent been disappointed yet! Heres some of my favorite things about them:

Happy Hour - San Felipes has one of the best happy hours in the valley. Their drinks and appetizers are half off from 4pm-7pm, and my bill for drinks and dinner with friends is typically $20-$30. You cant beat that!

Service - I usually sit up at the bar when I stop by, and they have some of the friendliest bartenders in town! They always make me feel at home when I stop by, and theyre quick to serve me during the late-night hours. The managers are also really good about hanging out and chatting with the customers to make them feel special. It works!

Food and Drinks - My favorite drink at San Felipes is probably the Mexican Iced Tea. Its a long island iced tea, but they use passion fruit vodka instead of the traditional unflavored vodka. As far as food goes, I REALLY like the baja chicken wrap, the sonoran chicken sandwich, and the steak burrito with green sauce. A quick tip - ANYTHING with the baja sauce is great :)

Overall, this place is a lot of fun, and I really like the laid back vibe. Ill definitely be back!"
4,"Great bagels & bialeys!  Service was great, food was fresh, bagels & bialeys were like NY! Ill be a regular here! Also check for specials on Tues & Fridays"
3,"Food is ok. Pad Thai is sub-par. The happy hour is very cool baby suburban around this joint. 
Its attached to Chandler Fashion Center, so its busy pretty much all of the time. happy hour specials are just ok, specialty drinks are pretty expensive with little taste and even less alcohol.
plus, i loathe happy hours that you can only enjoy in the ""bar"" area. the patio is the spot for HH, and its LOUD. not just with vapid chatter, but with the constant scraping of meatl chairs on the concrete. it sounds like im being picky, but its one of those sounds that makes your skin crawl and just kills your mood instantly - over and over and over.
anyway, if youre a big time up-and-comer and want everyone to know, this is the place for you."
2,"Burger was great, but the service wasnt so great. When thumbing through my wallet for cash, the owner rudely interrupted me and told me they dont accept cards, only cash payment. 

When my friend asked what he would recommend, he shoved a menu in his face and said ""Id recommend looking at a menu"". 

I fought back the urge to just leave and go somewhere else and ordered  the Good Ass burger, which was avocado and bacon, so you cant really go wrong with that. The fries were good and the burger was pretty good. 

Service: 1 star
Food: 4 stars

Average: 2 stars

5,"Tweet tweet.  I decided to follow Market Bistro on Twitter just recently and am sure glad I did.  This company really knows how to treat their followers. 

I have been a fan of Market Bistro for 2 years now, they have such a comfortable setting at both locations and the food is impeccable not to mention reasonably priced.

I have always opted for the Market pizza, a dish that includes artichokes, large sundried tomatoes and a flat parmesean encrusted dough.  There hasnt been one time that Ive visited Market and felt disappointed in portion size or my order.  I have such an appreciation for an establishment that takes pride in their foods ingredients, atmosphere and customer service methods.

As for salads,  If you can take the heat I would absolutely recommend the Arizona Salad.  The chipotle dressing, black beans, rice and tortilla crisps are a terrific blend of taste for your palette.  You will feel right at home here in the southwest with each and every bite.

If you havent already started your car or phoned in your order at Market, Im 100% sure you are crazy.

#BRAVO  (hashtagging seems appropriate here)."
5,"The food on its own is very good, probably worthy of a four star rating by itself, especially considering how difficult it is to find even passable Italian food in the West Valley.  I bumped Grazie up from four-stars to five-stars because the service is very, very good, ownership is attentive and the atmosphere is very pleasant.  As for the pizza in particular: for a NY native, finding decent pizza in Phoenix is close to impossible. Good thin-crust (Italian-style, as opposed to NY- or Chicago-style), like what they have at Grazie, does happen to be a bit easier to execute, and Grazie does it well. Would I have loved to find a great NY- or Chicago-style slice instead? Sure, but good pizza is good pizza nonetheless."
5,Great food and even better beer. Staff are always friendly.  My favorite microbrewery in the Valley.
3,"I came in  on an early Friday morning to buy a dozen and a half of donuts for my co- workers. The man behind the counter found it odd I order such an amountapparently, by the way he repeated my order. In my case 1 dozen would have been too little, 2 dozen too many and I didnt want to waste any. That alrady made me feel uncomfortable. Just fulfill whatever order you get, I am customer. It was my first time here, after many, many drive bys. He asked me what flavors and suggested to make a mix, I didnt have a preference, as I just liked an assortment. Again I was frowned upon. Just give me your bestselling flavors...whats the problem. Well, I guess it was once and never again. The donuts were fresh tasting, but the service was far beyond friendly. To bad, you could have earned a new customer."
1,Door clearly says drive-thru open 24 hours and lobby till midnight. Drove up at 10:30 and was told the lobby was closed...lame...
4,"Me and my sis were greeted with a pleasant smile and I like the whole $5 part with the coke and fries. I dont really enjoy drinking soda but Ill take it anyway especially if its fruity, they have all the old school pop in cans Shasta and RC I should learn to take more pics but this place is cramped inside and I may be claustrophobic. I had the portabello mushroom burger see pic it had rice and all this other stuff that just kinda fell out all over the place it was super messy but pretty tasty. The fries are soggy which ordinarily we wouldnt eat but they were really good we couldnt stop eating them. We sat on the back patio and got checked on by I am assuming was the owner she asked how we liked it, was way nice I love the friendliness of the place we left hekka full and happy! Next time we go we will probably just share an order of fries though."
1,"Heres a thought, dont post on the door to your restaraunt ""Up scale Mexican Food"" unless you can prove it.  This was not upscale, it was barely pass-able  as decent.  Didnt help that the waitress got both of our orders wrong.  Will not return."
3,"Rolling Hills is two executive courses, and great for a quick cheap round of golf.  Totally not an out of towner destination course, but a nice little local fave of mine.  The front nine is the old course, and is a bit like mini-golfing, a fun distraction.  You even get to hear the occasional strange animal sound from the zoo hidden behind the trees along a couple holes.  The back nine is a newer build, and is way more challenging and scenic.  Either way they both give a fantastic view of the valley, and its a great place to play a quick 9 holes after work in just over an hour

Only eaten at the clubhouse once, but both me and my bud liked our burgers, and it sits next to the 9th green, which is great for a little free entertainment."
4,"I remember my first visit to Delux,it was before heading over to shop in the craziness that is Last Chance. Anyway my friend suggested this spot because of their sweet potato fries...thats all she had to say, I was down!! Its a trendy little spot inside of a strip mall, it kinda looked outta place but it stood out in a good way.

I ordered the sweet potato fries they were yummy (I like mine a little crispier, but they were still delish)  and the CHINESE CHICKEN SALAD...Mmmmmm the flavors were amazing, the red peppers, cilantro, romaine and that peanuty vinaigrette is too die for! I was a little worried that I wasnt going to get full but this salad was easily large enough for 2.Im ashamed to say that the 3 times that I have been to Delux I have had this salad, Im hooked. Next time I promise I will venture out and try one of these burgers everyone keeps raving about...maybe."
4,"The ""hood"" is a colloquialism not intended to imply ""ghetto"" or any particularly dangerous neighborhood. I am a proud resident of the Biltmore hood and my neighbors are retired Mormon doctors who all own corgis and drive Buicks and have umbrellas with ""Vanguard Investments"" emblazoned on them.

Anyway, even though the neighborhood isnt particularly risky its dangerous just having this place so close to me. After a particularly harsh day at work I treated myself to the carne asada burro combo. Highly addictive, and theres probably enough fat in the tortilla alone -- never mind the filling -- to keep me and an African village or two going for a week or so. Nevertheless, its delicious and a great antidote to an evening spent with too much single-malt and too many cigars and some women named Wanda and Clarissa. Those who know . . . . know . . . 

Anyway, go and enjoy."
2,"Maybe it was an off night - it happens to the best of us.  Ive hung out at AZ88 before several times, but on the night I plan to review the place they were so off.  AZ88 Buffalo CK Sandwich -- Ill eat one or two buffalo CK wing, but to make it a sandwich, I cant recommend.  Too much sauce! Also, make sure you chew fast because after a while the buns begin to go soggy - umm mushy bread with CK cover in buffalo sauce.... (Toast the CK itll dry some of sauce and give a crispier texture)  Service was off too!  I had 1 beer and 2 waters -- thats all.  If you know me I like a few bottles and at least a jug of water with my meal :) - I know I cant get enough H2O!  I understand the place is popping, but after being seated, there was almost no direction for the wait staff.  Ambience is always cool and love the layout and the feel of the place.  Better luck next time! - Enjoy!"
5,We went there right before my Grandmas 100th birthday.  There were about 20 of us.  The place was busy but we called ahead and they put our name in even though we still didnt have a final count of people.  The place was busy but I know why.  EVERYONE had a different dish and we all loved it.  Everyone wanted to taste each others food because we all liked it so much.  We all seem to think we are food critics and we loved this place.  Extensive menu and they seemed to nail everything we had!  The staff was amazing and would go back in a heartbeat!
4,"I really like this place. I spent 2 years in Honolulu and used to eat at this great little place in China Town. I have been craving that food since I got off the plane to move back to Phoenix. Well, I found China Chili and I am SO glad I did! The Honey Walnut Prawns are so  yummy! The fried rice and lo-mein noodles are smoky tasting, and hot out of the wok. Is it healthy? Maybe not. Is it non-greasy? Um... not really. Is it delicious when youre craving some really filling Chinese food? Yes. I wish it were closer to my place so I could have it more often, but Im sure Im sparing my waistline of more issues!"
4,"Judging by some of the reviews, maybe I went on good days because Ive enjoyed my trips.  Good food and good service.  

The last time I went, I sat at the bar for lunch on a Sunday, ordered an All~Star Burger with BBQ sauce and enjoyed some sports.  The bartender was nice and the food came quick, which was good because I was hungry (I inhaled the burger).

Ill be returning on a regular basis once football starts back up."
5,"After talking to a number of bartenders in the area -- and doing some fairly extensive personal research -- I feel pretty comfortable saying that if you want the best cocktails in the Phoenix area, you should head to the Jade Bar at the Sanctuary Resort.  

This is off the beaten path a bit, and after a few miles down streets with no street lights, it felt a bit like driving to a ski lodge up in the mountains.  Its worth the drive though.  I had two excellent cocktails (""The Last Word"" and a ""Pendemums Club""), and one enjoyable and informative conversation with Jillian the bartender.  Wish I could have made some of their mixology classes."
5,"When I moved to the Valley, our first place was a rental in Old Town.  The previous tenant/owner generously left a bunch of take-out menus for nearby restaurants.  Defalcos was one of them.  But not being a fan of the sandwich, it took me four years and a move to actually go in.  What a fool I was.  This place is fantastic!  

First off, its not just a deli, its an Italian market.  Had I actually read the full name of the place, I might have known that.  Its also got a somewhat extensive selection of wine available for purchase.  So now weve moved from a deli, to a grocer, to a wine shop.  Dont forget the pasta dishes and the pastry, too.  

My fave sandwich is the tomato, mozz, and basil on a sub roll with olive oil and balsamic.  Simple, yet perfection.  Im a huge fan of those sub rolls by the way.  Crusty on the outside, but not so crusty that it makes a big mess every time you take a bite, yet soft and chewy on the inside.  Its always about the bread for me.  Great selection of prepared salads in the deli as well.  One of the best red potato salads Ive had in a long time.

It certainly wont take me another four years to go back.  I think Ive been there just about every week in the last month!"
3,"For such a small space, Stinkweeds definitely does a good job of packing as much variety as they can in their store. As far as record stores go, theyve got a pretty decent collection in both CDs and vinyl. My only qualm with this place is that they tend to only carry newer stuff or the more popular titles of indie genres. If youre like me and like to peruse through older and hard-to-find collections, be sure to check out Tracks in Wax a few blocks down the street on Central. That being said, this is definitely a place youll want to drop into. Their selection of concert/music video DVDs is pretty solid as is what their magazine stand has to offer. Sure, its no Amoeba but its the next best thing."
4,"Loved the spinach salad.  Ill have to find out what kind of dressing that was in it.  Yumm  The beer selection is the first thing that I would come back for.  We ordered the Gourmet White pizza which has:
Olive Oil and Garlic base pizza with Sun-Dried Tomatoes, Provolone, Mozzarella, Feta, Roma Tomatoes and Onions.
Yummy. Especially the crust, which is a wheat crust that compliments the pizza very well.  Nothing left on my plate!  Hope to try the meatier, yes, I made up that word, pizzas next time!"
4,"I enjoyed our dinner here although I think this might be more of a happy hour destination.  We had the trio of dips which were lovely.  I had the house enchiladas with grilled chicken and that was delicious.  The rice and beans left something to be desired.  Husband had the pork green chile mac and cheese which he enjoyed but felt was underseasoned.    

I ordered the peach sangria on the recommendation of a friend but found it to be too wine-y for me.  I was expected a glass full of fruit as is customary and there was one tiny lone piece of peach clinging sadly to the bottom of the glass.  The waiter was kind enough to swap it out for the passionfruit sangria which I enjoyed much more.  I also tried the blood orange mojito and the coconut mojito.  They were both fabulous and LARGE!  If it were up to me, Id make them slightly less sweet but they were still fantastic nonetheless.  

We shared the macadamia nut brownie and ice cream for dessert and that was wonderful.  The brownie was sort of like the bastard child between cake and a brownie.  Denser than cake, not as dense as a brownie.  

Our server was wonderful.  Friendly, attentive, and helpful."
3,"I visited on high reviews.  I think its a little over-rated, but good none the less.  My burger was a bit overcooked, food was overpriced but the service was top notch.  Great service, exciting atmosphere (although a bit cramped).  I would go again with hopes of a better burger."
1,"Staff is nice, and thats it.
They use very cheap tires that only last for a year."
3,"La Condesa is in a rather unassuming location in Phoenix.  But has a nice atmosphere when you get inside.  The first thing I noticed was their huge salsa bar.  We sat down and were brought menus and chips.  I tried most of their salsas.  They all had their own very unique flavor.  the peanut salsa was really interesting.  My favorite was their tomatillo salsa.  

I ordered the Oaxaca Mole taco and a carne asada taco.  The mole was excellent with great flavor.  The carne asada was bland and flavorless...huh?  I dumped salsa on the carne asada taco and when finished was rather disappointed in that particular offering.

Also ordered their calabacitas.  They were seasoned well and tasted great.  

I had a bite of my partners pork taco and it was amazing.  

I am glad we found La Condesa and I will definitely visit again to try some more of their menu offerings."
