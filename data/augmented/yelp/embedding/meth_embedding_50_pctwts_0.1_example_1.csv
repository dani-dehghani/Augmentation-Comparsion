2,to make a long story short --- we had a coupon for this place.  We know its an ASU hang out but the coupon was for spend 50.00 get 25.00 off.  Ok service was not good --- when we got the bill the pizza and wings were charged separate -- not right -- it was a together order per the menu.  We had a pitcher of beer and a single beer plus food -- bill was almost 70.00 -- we gave the waitress the coupon -- she had to change the bill for the pizza and wings --- then she came back and stated the coupon had a 18% gratuity and service charge of 13.59.  Based on what ???  that actually ate up the coupon and we ended up paying full price anyway.  Never again --- and the food was fair --- not a good place to return to -- ASU take it away -- its all yours -----

1,Tonight at Noca Phoenix No dinner -waited 1.5 hours with no communication only to be told they were out of the fish I ordered left the restaurant 2 hrs later very hungry   Very  disappointing
5,"This is a family owned local restaurant at its best. If you like to explore and support locally owned businesses, you should definitely give this one a try. They have a big menu and I have tried breakfast and lunch and both were excellent, but the breakfast is particularly good. I love the breakfast burrito. (to the reviewer that complained about the greasy chorizo...hello, it is chorizo, chorizo is sausage). I would go out of my way to stop and eat here whenever in the general area."

1,"Im sad to report that we dined here for lunch and it was inedible:(  Chef Aaron please come by and monitor your staff.  We had the eggplant sandwich and is was a disaster.  It was so overly oily and the bun and fries overwhelmed the plate.  The shrimp and grits were so average with the shrimp being of low quality.  The beer menu looked fabulous.  So I guess if this is just a watering hole things will be fine...but if you choose to dine be prepared to leave hungry and unsatisfied.  We hope this turns around.  The decor is cool and the staff is really fun and helpful...and we are hopeful for a great place to visit in the ""hood""."

5,Great fresh food and vegetarian options! I will definitely return!!
5,"Great selection of vitamins and supplements, good prices and I can get the special treats our cat likes while Im picking up the goods for myself. Plus their rewards program is pretty straightforward. I also like that they are not ""all over you"" like the other local chain is when you walk in the door.  I highly recommend the Vitamin Shoppe on Camelback!"

2,"K.. I dont get it.  I go there every now and then.  I have only had the pizza.  It is a step up from supermarket frozen pie.  I like it because I like frozen pizzas... but I think the ratings given are a bit misleading.   It is ""cost effective"" and if I think this place might be amazing for stoners..  But if you are looking for high quality pizza this is not it.  I would however get it over the chain stuff."
5,"When I was a dancer I always came here for everything. Shoes, leotards, skirts, and accessories. They have every type of dance shoe and a wide variety of everything dancers need and want.  Im not sure how many dance shops are in the area, but all of my instructors always recommended this place which is not very close to our studio. The staff is all very kind and knowledgeable which trust me is a very good thing. Dance shoes can get confusing! There are at least three different kind of tap shoes!  Dees also has costume rentals so if you ever need a crazy costume at the last minute Dees can help you out with that too!"

2,"This location is a glorified garage sale. It smells and nobody speaks English. Children are running free pulling clothes off racks and smashing into people.  If you are lucky, you can find shoes, but I have never found jack shit for clothes. Go upstairs to Marshalls and spare yourself."

5,"LOVE Chino Bandido.  The snickerdoodle cookie they give you with your meal is heaven.  Well, all of the food might actually be heaven, but usually by the time I get to the snickerdoodle I could die happy on the spot."
1,Just called at 9:45 to ask when they were open until. Woman said they were already closed but website says open until 10 pm. Really?? Obviously dont care about patronage...mexican is a dime a dozen in the new NEW Mexico...no thanks. Next!

1,"Well...no worries for the continued bad service...awful prices...average inventory....and just overall bad experience....because the store closes forever this weekend. I have never cared for the place....so I definitely wont miss it. However if your looking for some decent electronic gear at 60-80% off....then this is your weekend to go. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends"
3,We had fun but it is definately more for kids 5 and younger .  The pretend store was fun and we all had a blast playing in the noodles.

Dont order mixed drinks, dont order wine, both are gross unless your sole purpose is to get trashed, which is the mission of every underage and young, young 20-something at this bar. This is the place youd go to with your fake ID because when youre 19 this is what you think a bar should be. Expect people over drinking and throwing up very early on in the evening in the bathroom."
4,"not a bad place for pizza... it is very infomral and the pizza is good... they have a nice beer selection... if you want to get a pie, beer and salad in Old Town and that is all you really want this is the place... the menu is baiscally pizza, beer and salad... but all good..."

3,"Its been a few weeks since Ive eaten here..but its only now that I have time to write this long, overdue review. Hm...its upscale...kind of comparable to Mikunis in Sac...but their menu is to some extent, smaller and less tasty.  I dont recall exactly what i ordered but...I wouldnt recommend this place to friends.  It was okay, nothing that stood out...and trust me, food, when its good...it sticks with me.  :)   Without further a due, edible but i would never crave for it again."

4,"Cibo is positively adorable.  I love the atmosphere.  I love the little house, and the yard.  I love the excessively busy yet amazingly friendly servers.  I love the iced tea.  I love the bread.  I love the Antipasto plate.  I love making ad-hoc bruchetta out of said bread and Antipasto.  I love the margherita pizza. Just on a Thursday afternoon alone, I dont think Id ever come with a large group of people.  It just doesnt seem like a wise life decision. Really? Its love overall.  Love, love, love, love.  When I can, Im dragging my family here."

5,"This was the first real ballet I have ever been to, and I was so excited it was the Nutcracker! I have been wanting to see the Nutcracker for years.  Thanks to Lindsey and Yelp, I had the opportunity to go and the performance was just stunning. When I walked in, I noticed the lobby was beautifully decorated, a gentleman reading a story to children and a ballet dancer posing for pictures. The bartenders we bought our drinks from, was very friendly and accomodating.  I cant say enough about how beautiful the performance was from the dancers, the sets, the costumes, etc. Just incredible. I may just take my daughter to see it with me this season...."

2,Good service. The waitress was friendly. but the food was just icky and the Place smelled bad! like sewage pipes. I had a glass of wine. there was no way I was going to order a mixed drink while she was tearing the bar down.  I didnt feel good after eating the food. I had a coupon so it made the total bill cheap. But i would have walked out if I had to pay full price because The atmosphere they boast should provide better food. No Not good dont go

4,"Ok folks, I usually am not a scottsdale girl.  I usually enjoy a dive bar at happy hour or my parents house (love you mom and dad!) But I have to say I had a blast here!! I was there to help with a Jon Ric Fashion Show and had the time of my life.   Our server was so cute! she was always right there to make sure we had ice, our bottle, and mixers.  Plus I dont remember seeing a dirty glass EVER at our table! Im a server and that is not easy to do.  So good job staff.   The dancers were great and the music was so varied! there really was something for everyone.  I would go back again in a heart beat!"

5,"Just came from there as part of my trip down the Apache Trail. My 9year old daughter loved it so much she insisted on stopping in again on the way back. The town is really cute with tons of photo ops. We picked up a few fun souveniers and some prickly pear fudge. We did this in 100 degree temps and still enjoyed it. For those curmudgeons moaning about this being a tourist trap, RELAX....the kids love it. This 40 something mom loved it. Its free to just walk around.  But definitely do the Mystery Shack. Weird and fun. I actually got dizzy in it."

4,"First of all note the name changed to AMF Scottsdale Lanes. Hey it doesnt smell! Its a nice bowling alley and I can imagine spending a few hours here like I did tonight with my Phoenix Fabulous Forty Womens Club.  The bar is very nice for a bowling alley. They even have a pool table!  They serve decent food and cold drinks to your lanes with waiter service.  All the lanes, screens and scoring boards are new, clean and state of the art. Theres no old smelly gross carpet to be avoided either, which is classic of bowling alleys I have been in!  Prices for rental equipment and lane use is average cost.  I had a great time and will definitely return to enjoy the faculties again and again.  Oh and the staff were so nice and professional also!"

2,"Uhhh...These are supposed to be carne fries?  ASU boys think that these are the best carne fries. Me thinks not. The carne fries consist of boiled meat AND the order is wrong. Its supposed to have the guacamole on top of the sour cream on top of the melted cheese over the meat, but they just dumped the boiled carne asada on top of the sour cream. I told some ASU boy about this, but he said that I probably had a different person making my carne fries  the wrong way. What a disappointment, but I ate everything anyway because Im fat like that. hahha"

3,"Live entertainment, friendly, restroom clean, my dish was good, but my hubbies dish the meat was not seasoned at all and for a fajita they gave him a burrito flour size tortilla and took about 15 mins to bring a second one.  Plus hrs are posted wrong on yelp. States open from 6 am to 2 pm even though they serve breakfast, lunch and dinner."

2,What a lame store.  The employees didnt say hi to me once and were totally unhelpful.  Their dog food selection is decent but their dog toy selection is worse than PetSmart.  Too bad too because good quality pet stores are hard to find.  There has to be something else around here and I would go out of my way to find it.
5,"So this is my current Sunday All day Happy Hour JAM! This place is SO GOOD and Im not a huge fan of all off Fox Restaurants concepts. The Chefs Pizza of the day hasnt let me down yet... We dont even ask we just order it!  The Chefs Board is pretty good too! My fav dish right now is the Broccolini - super simple but its just so light / fresh and make sure you try the Bucatini & Meatballs if your their for happy hour.  Awesome open feel to it - super friendly staff. The bartenders are great - I wanna say the dark haired brunets name was Nicole - works weekends & knows how to make a mean bloodymary / Red Rooster in their case.  The parking / Valet situation is a little annoying but remember the sign says ""Complimentary"" not Mandatory - park your car yourself if you want."

3,"Bar Smith has potential to be a chic hot spot in the heart of downtown; just a few steps away from the symphony hall, Chase Field, and the US airways Arena. However, this place, despite its pseudo-hipness fails to deliver in the cocktail department, which, with its continuously crappy music, would be the only real reason youd come to this bar. Its really a 2.5 star place-- bartenders are nice,but dont really get the job done. When youre paying over $8/drink, youd at least expect them to do that. The roof is cool though so an extra .5 stars for that."
2,Ive been here twice for lunch. Its okay but I wont be coming back. The portions are small. I had one of the curries and it was good. But I had the pad thai which the menu said contains chicken and shrimp. Not a single shrimp on the plate. Cheap bastards. One of the lower quality Thai restaurants Ive been to in Phoenix next to Thai Hut.

A good time was had by all :)"

1,"When I was growing up we called this the canal. In other parts of town it is still called the canal. In some places people actually fish from it. I think they die right after they eat their catch, which is why you dont see them very often. Over the years you periodically hear about dead bodies being found in the canal as well.  Google it. What is so annoying about this is that Scottsdale, is trying to make it seem like this isnt the same heinous canal thats always been there. When I heard about the development around the Scottsdale Waterfront, I couldnt figure out what they were talking about. What water? Then I started cracking up when I found out it was the canal. Come on Scottsdale, you can put a dress and lipstick on a pig, but it is still a pig. You are not fooling anyone."
3,"This place was good, just not as good as I had hoped based on the reviews.  I would have given the place 3 1/2.  Since I cant, I decided to balance out another reviewer who gave the place 4 stars but also thought it deserved 3 1/2. Positive notes:  Hot sauce had some bite to it, chips were good, Camarones culichi had a wonderful sauce.  Lots of fresh limes served with the meal.  Full bar. Not-so-positive notes:  Shrimp in the Camarones culichi was overcooked (cardinal sin for a seafood place).  The shrimp coctail was just ok - good sized boiled shrimp, but not too much flavor.   If driving by and hungry I would stop in again, but not if I have to drive too far out of the way."

1,"Water park is OK.  However, the parking lot has ZERO security.  No security patrols, no cameras.  My catalytic converters were stolen off my truck in the parking lot at Big Surf Tempe today.  Sawed right off in broad daylight.  According to the cops, car break ins and catalytic converter thefts happen frequently here.  BEWARE!  The water park management doesnt give a shit.  Even the cop laughs because they always say the same thing:  ""Our camera is broken but its getting fixed next week"".  What a joke.  If you go, have someone drop you off.  Youve been warned!"

3,"I was not impressed. For a business traveler, there are better choices nearby.  When I drove up, the valet told me there was no self park, but I could see it less than 100 yards away from my room. I used it during my stay, and it was convenient and much less expensive.  The entry of the hotel was constantly blocked by party goers, and I couldnt find any alternate entrance/exit.  My bill was wrong at checkout. They adjusted it, but then mysteriously placed an additional unauthorized charge of $13.94 on my credit card.  Seriously wishing I opted for Embassy Suites across the road..."

I have to say, I was super disappointed as I have always heard rave reviews, now Im starting to question who I associate with and their taste in food. Service=slow. Food=just tastes like salt Noise=loud and they do a dance...like a lot. Go somewhere else and skip Joes Crabs."

1,"We ordered $40 worth of pizza for takeout and it took almost 2 hours -- was told 20 minutes. We were not compd for anything. When I expressed my dissatisfaction, they offered to give me $40 credit toward my next order. I asked for this in writing, and they gave me the ""we cant provide it in writing -- we wrote your name down and have you on record"" line. Guess what -- I called back a couple months later and they had no record. They refused to honor the credit....and were rude. I asked to speak to the owner, and was told ""hes out of town."" The pizza is mediocre at best. I have zero tolerance for businesses such as this. PLEASE spend your money somewhere else that deserves to be patronized."

Except for the grilled fish tacos. Thus 2 stars. Not 1. When I lived at DCRanch, I thought this would be a less expensive, less formal place to hang out.

We were so pumped that there was Kool Aid on the menu, so we ordered that immediately. I dont know why every restaurant doesnt do this... Kool Aid is amazing. The service was decent - our waitress was quite friendly, and the food came out quick. I got biscuits and gravy, which was pretty delish. The gravy was thick and filling. So filling, in fact, that I couldnt finish them. I also got a side of mac and cheese which was not great, and I didnt eat a lot of it. Overall, Id give this place a solid 3. Id come back again, but mostly because my husband thought it was some kind of wonderful."

Well this time Thunder Dan didnt hit this buzzer beater. First off it does get two stars for a reason so lets start there. The atmosphere is great. The venue is super cool and there is tons of tvs.  Thats pretty much where it stops. The food isnt great and is relatively slow. I have had a burger, wings, the chicken quesadilla and a couple of other things which didnt impress me. Plus the service was super slow... This kind of reminds me of the Suns-Bulls series super exciting but just misses the mark of greatness. I am sticking with my old faithful two blocks away Zipps."

2,This Baja Fresh really didnt impress me.  Its pricey considering that all youre getting is meat in a tortilla.  It doesnt have that Mexican feel to it and is unoriginal.  There were bugs on the wall.  The food is good however.  Nothing special though.  Since its a corporate chain you cant expect sizzling flavor but I was left unsatisfied.  There are better Mexican food places to go to.

Since I cant, I decided to balance out another reviewer who gave the place 4 stars but also thought it deserved 3 1/2. Positive notes:  Hot sauce had some bite to it, chips were good, Camarones culichi had a wonderful sauce.  Lots of fresh limes served with the meal.  Full bar. Not-so-positive notes:  Shrimp in the Camarones culichi was overcooked (cardinal sin for a seafood place).  The shrimp coctail was just ok - good sized boiled shrimp, but not too much flavor.   If driving by and hungry I would stop in again, but not if I have to drive too far out of the way."

I think this was featured in diners, drive-ins, and dives.  It was very good but just wow huge.  It came with a side of ruffled chips.  Very nice people.  The fruit smoothies were good the horchata decent but not the best Ive had.  Great bang for your buck though.  Id go again and try something a bit more sensibly sized. There was a wait of about 15 minutes or so.  Very popular on a Saturday for lunch :)"
2,"I was so disappointed in this place. I just moved out here and was craving filipino food and found this place based on reviews. Although the reviews were average, I was hoping to catch this place on one of its good days. Nope, not the case.  The place is not much to look at and the food did not look good. I was hesitant to eat here but was so hungry and saw that they had my fav dishes, sinigang and diniguan. They were both ok, Ive def had better. I ordered the pancit for my husband and it was terrible! He had maybe two bites and threw the rest away.  Oh well, wont be coming back here. Theres another filipino place in Phoenix so well be trying that next. Gingeroot, also in Chandler, is way better but expensive. Guess its worth the price when you have your cravings!"

1,The Duce is a disaster.  As an Arizona native and a downtown local I root for cool interesting places downtown. I wanted to love this place. The 1st time we tried the Duce I was extremely let down by the customer service. The parking is atrocious. Its as if you are inconveniencing the staff by asking where you order food. They were out of just about everything we wanted to order. So disappointing.  However I decided to give them a second shot. Everyone has a rough night. We went to an event there last night the entertainment by Scandalesque was AMAZING... same TERRIBLE customer service from the staff at the Duce. Management needs to wake up. Great concept. Horrific customer service and staff.

2,"I got the banana nutella cupcake and love the banana bread-like cupcake. However, the frosting is way too sweet and overpowers the banana flavor of the cupcake. As many reviewers have already mentioned, the cupcake is also over-priced at $3.75 each for the size and the lack of creativity.  With so many desert/snack places in Scottsdale, I am unlikely to come back here."

5,"This review is for locals...the Hyatt isnt just a beautiful spot to stay it, its also a perfect spot to just sit and enjoy the day! Ive done this several times, many times for dinner and drinks afterward on the patio. Most recently, I decided to set up shop and do some work from one of the comfy chairs on the outdoor patio which allowed me to enjoy the gorgeous Arizona weather and still get some work done. They do an excellent job of making the hotel amenities comfortable and welcoming.  For hotel guests, if you are planning to stay here, be sure to look into staying in one of the rooms that sit on the man made lake. They have great patios right on the water so when you wake up, you could have breakfast on the lake! It doesnt get much better than that."

5,"We made a last minute decision to go out on New Years Eve.  The restaurant was very busy but after just a few minutes a couple of seats opened at the bar ( our favorite place to sit) and the bar tenders, Blake, Kennan and Clair were ON IT!  They were very busy, but did not miss a new face at the bar or a glass writing for a refill.  The food was excellent. My husband had the baseball steak with twice baked potato and I had Prime Rib  with lobster tail and twice baked potato. Everything was cooked to perfection. Oh yes! Start with the garlic cheese bread as it is yummy!"

3,"I wasnt sure what to expect. This was stop 1 on the pub crawl.  There was an emo looking couple in a booth a table full of patrons (they looked like regulars) The artwork on the walls was dark and ecclectic, but the place didnt have a dark feel. I cant say this would be ""my"" bar. But if I were in the neighborhood I would go to this bar for a few drinks and some hummus."
3,"Typical Taco Bell with typical Taco Bell menu (other than the Popeyes Fish they serve from the same kitchen/counter). Not sure if some of the people in the kitchen could speak English. One employee on break sat in front of a small TV in the seating area which was VERY LOUD and ANNOYING. Every table was dirty despite it not being very busy, and the bottles of condiments at the ""fixins"" bar were filthy. Cant beat the prices, though. As usual, I left ""stuft"" on two bucks."

5,"WOW!!! A real European bakery!  This was awesome, after having lunch next door at La Buona Pasta we took home some kalachis and walnut roll home for later.  The cakes are varied and everything looks buttery good and sweet.  Having grown up near a Swedish bakery it kind of remind me of that--donuts, cakes, cheesecakes, breads and other European specialties.  The shop is also set up with a small section of Polish-centric groceries.  mmmm maybe I will have to learn to cook some Polish dishes.  Next special occasion my cake is coming from there.  :-) The one we visited is  13331 W. Indian School Rd. Litchfield Park, AZ 85340 USA 623-547-4655"

5,"Tempe Beach Park - such a gem in our landlocked State... Sure, its a man-made water source, and yes - its pretty nasty if you plan on swimming inside Tempe Town Lake, but its gorgeous during the day and at night too! Ive done a handful of triathlons that started and ended at Tempe Beach Park, and most recently, I did the PetSmart Walk (go team Yelp) that took place at the park as well...  With the proximity of the park to ASU / Mill Ave, it really is a fun place to go hang for an afternoon - no matter whats going on there... My only words of wisdom - dont swallow the lake water!"

The whole sushi experience is very authentic and perfect place to hang out with friends or take a date :D There is only one thing I dont like. Sometimes it gets to busy so make sure to get there early (around 7 P.M) if you want to be seated right away.

So far Ive bought a vintage print, an awesome dress that I have received tons of compliments on, cool earrings, and some other kitchen items.  The staff are always friendly.  When you go, make sure you check out the Burt Reynolds beefcake poster they have behind the counter. Great strore!"

The food was literally inedible, everything was either too cold or burnt to a char, nothing tasted good. We decided to try the desert and the cream puff (Im unsure how you can mess that up) was petrified and the cream was so gross I spit it out. The smell of the flan actually made us gag, we had such an awful time I complained to the manager. She didnt even seem to care, and gave us 20% off of a lunch we didnt even eat. We were disgusted by this place, and we will never, ever go back. Dont do it, you will regret it!"

4,"The Yucca Tap Room is wonderful for the following reasons: 1.  They dont actually have taps 2.  They do have live band karaoke 3.  They do have table shuffle board.  4.  They do have the naked lady game.... otherwise known as Photo Hunt... the best bar game of all time.  (A note to both ladies and gents, the naked ladies are much less distracting than the naked men... and hair, heels, and bra straps are heavily relied on as the sourced of difference between the image. 5.  Its a good mix of people and pretty cheap.  Unpretentious and awesome! 6.  Its bikeable, but I feel like Ive traveled long distances to get there (I think that is because crossing Souther is intimidating)"

The Ravioli di Zucca Appetizer (see pics) which is: roasted butternut squash ravioli with parmesan, brown butter, sage and crumbled amaretti...OMG it was just delicious but a perfect appetizer to share , its available in two sizes I got the small one. The sweetness from the crumbled amaretti is a very nice touch. I ordered the Healthy Fish again (see pics) and once again it was perfect! My guest ordered the Penne Salsiccia (see pics) which had Italian sausage, caramelized onions and pecorino cheese! The sausage was really good and for just $5 you cant beat that!"

Thats the only thing Ive ever ordered here (I go elsewhere for my usual espresso needs), so I cant speak on the rest of their drinks. But, I dont imagine the rest of their drinks being bad; their Iced Mochas are very enjoyable. The service can be spotty. There are a couple ladies that work there that are sweet and take good care of the customers. But Ive also encountered a couple of employees that arent friendly and/or are super slow. Whatever; Tullys isnt my usual haunt. But its good for what it is: fast-food-coffee."

The sandwiches are all good, the salads make great sides instead of the chips and the tiny cherry sized tomatoes are to die for whether you get it on the bruchetta or cheese board plate.  Thursday late happy hour gets pretty busy and so does friday late afternoon into late evening.  Saturday night it picks up after happy hour ends.  Wish they had burgers and fries like the Living Room in downtown Phoenix."

It felt to me like this hotel was trying to be a hotel that you would find in vegas.  the rooms are overpriced, there is no storage in them and they give you like 5 hangers total.  The water here is awful so dont drink it.  The pool area is nice, and the room service is very quick.  So those aspects of this hotel are nice.  I am not sure i would spend 300 buks to stay here though again.  I am not really into the party scene but if you are this might be your kind of place.  Id rather be at a pub bar or sports bar personally but to each their own!"

Really, the TC cakes were just cakes... No flavor, no texture, dry...

As their products now do, at least to me."

I was expecting more Island style food, or more adventurous treats. *  Bar was great. *  Tuna Poke thing was fantastic. *  Cajun burger was terrific, but the bun was too dense and troublesome. *  Chicken CocoaJoe was a bust.  Chicken a little dry and under-seasoned, rice and beans were bland (needs a giant ham-hock and about 3 more days).  The Plaintain was overflavored, but underseasoned (they dont neem much more than salt and time). Awesome location. Menu will expand I am sure. Repaint the bathroom please."

Hes very professions and informative. Good customer service combines with talent at the craft."
1,My daughter and I went in for pedicures and gel sets... was incredibly surprised to hear the total was $120. even with a coupon!!! When I got home I noticed that my pedicure wasnt the best... I really dont mind paying top dollar for top dollar services but even with a coupon it wasnt worth it. Wont be back...

2,"I had high hopes for this restaurant, but to be honest, it let me down.  The wild mushroom and goat cheese salad was phenomenal.  From there it was downhill.  Great ambiance, though I think they are trying too hard to be a steakhouse.   Most importantly though...  Given it is a seafood restaurant, they sure didnt know how to cook my fish.  It was fried and oily (and was not marketed that way on the menu!)  I wanted something light and left feeling like I ate a ton of bricks.  My friends scallops - she said they were ""okay"" and not better than that. Oh, and the prices are set as if it were a steakhouse too. (Note: if it were, which its not.) Mediocre at best."

3,"We were visiting again, so of course that means at least 2 trips to Sugar Bowl!  The food, service and ice cream were good as always, but WOW, the prices sure have gone up.  I know that the economy sucks, but for what we got, the prices just dont seem to justify it.  We had different waitresses both times.  The fist was efficient but not very warm.  We had Sandra on our second visit - and YES, she remembered us again!  Could not believe it.  She is very friendly and can really keep up when they get swamped.  We will be back, but maybe only once per visit instead of 2 (or 3 or 4) times.  Just cant afford those prices for what you get."

1,"Tried a couple Tammie Coe cupcakes and a mini muffin two weeks ago... Unfortunately for them, I also sampled Ollie Cakes... No wonder Ollie Cakes, aka Urban Cookie, won Cupcake Wars and Tammie Coe sits in high rent selling pretty sugar disguised as a cupcake. Drive a few miles north, get whatever the special cupcake of the day is along with a Brown Velvet and Lemon, and save saying you enjoyed Tammie Coe for impressing snooty folk who wouldnt know yummy if it bit them on the butt! Really, the TC cakes were just cakes... No flavor, no texture, dry... And I cant say how impressed I was that the clerk shoved all my selections into one, tiny, flat bag meant for cookies or sandwiches!  Apparently presentation and flavor preservation mean nothing... As their products now do, at least to me."

He is friendly and chipper, but not so much so that hes annoying as your first human contact of the day. He is generous with the toppings and speedy."

2,"Well what can i say, if you like a club atmosphere and girls have naked walking around at night  this is your type of place.  It felt to me like this hotel was trying to be a hotel that you would find in vegas.  the rooms are overpriced, there is no storage in them and they give you like 5 hangers total.  The water here is awful so dont drink it.  The pool area is nice, and the room service is very quick.  So those aspects of this hotel are nice.  I am not sure i would spend 300 buks to stay here though again.  I am not really into the party scene but if you are this might be your kind of place.  Id rather be at a pub bar or sports bar personally but to each their own!"

Well, the chips are thin and salty yumness and I love the salsa.  They keep you filled up and arent like other places which try to ignore an empty container! Number 16 Combo is my guilty pleasure!  I have had it many times the way its intended:  Chicken enchiladas with red sauce...but lately Ive been getting it with Fundito sauce and Ive gotta tell you:  Im hooked!  Try it........its a little more $$$ but SO worth it! I havent had desert since Im gluten free but the size of the fried ice cream is Gigantic.  My daughter swears by it! Man, I wish they were open right now...cravings have begun anew...."

3,"I finally tried Spicy Pickle last week. I like the name and was intrigued about their menu. Paninis, soups, salads, pizzetas, nothing out of the ordinary. I had a half sandwich ( Sausalito Bandido?), half salad combo ( Spinach salad). Food was fresh and good. The sandwich could have stand a little more meat, it was truly flat. The salad was crisp and dressing was on the side, which I appreciated.   On my way out I got a chocolate chip cookie that was OK. I love cookies and they have to be pretty bad for me not to like them. This one, I kid you not, must have had maybe 3-4 chocolate chips? So if youre craving chocolate, this is not the cookie for you."

1,"Wow! I cant believe this place gets so many good reviews.  I was hauled here once by co-workers looking for a cheap meal. But, how much value does your lunch dollar have when you dont even want to eat the food? Dry and sticky rice; ""white meat chicken"" unidientifiable as such, and a sweet glaze that provided the only flavor. Quite frankly, it was disgusting, and none of the dishes my co-workers had looked any better (though they seemed to be fine with them). I should know to stay away from restaurants that have pictures of their menu items on the wall. The one star is only for the fast and friendly service."

1,"Have been an Ulta customer for a long time, but had never tried the salon until recently.  Was a HORRIBLE experience.  My stylist, Delia, ran 45 minutes late to start me, and on several occasions during the hair cut, stopped and kept looking around.  She made various odd faces as if to say my hair was a mess.  She not only didnt listen to what I wanted, but shot down the only thing I did ask for.  She said I wouldnt look good.  At the end of the painful ordeal, she then charged me for a conditioning service I didnt ask for.  At that point she directed me to the line at the front of the store, after which I waited in, they then sent me back to the salon to make the price correction.  (happened twice, then I asked for a manager)  Was very unprofessional all around and would NEVER go back!!!"

1,"The organization is grand with a ton of selection but the employees could care less about costumer service.  It is very amazing with the amount of unemployed people in the city they have to hire the most incompetent individuals....  Im not going to be ignorant and say they are ALL bad, but a few in the bunch seem to make it difficult to be a repeat costumer.  Try talking to a manager at this location and you will be routed around the store till you finally get some one that states ""the manager is off till next week.""  i will stay a website purchaser until they change their policy at this location and hire individuals with a better standard"

They just moved to a great place up the street (where Verde used to be for locals) with more room so now everything isnt so crammed! Not that we all didnt enjoy their original house, this one just says, ""Im still awesome, I just stepped up a notch."" Everything is delicious. I love their 5 Spot, the waffles are great, and their lunch specials are always amazing. If you like jelly - try their homemade stuff. Try the bacon."

2,"The food is good here, ordered the Mole enchiladas with no complaints, however we also ordered a skinny margarita which was not very strong and $15 ea! The regular margaritas are fine and priced okay at $8, but to charge $15 without warning is usury. The service was okay, not great. The menu is also hard to read because the type and busy background design. I would have given 4 stars if the margaritas were $11, but $15?? This is not Modern Steak or the W !!"

The yogurt tastes great, is light and refreshing and somewhat healthy if you avoid all of the chocolately/candy toppings yet they offer tons of fruit options.

A must try, plus they have punch cards for free fro yo after a couple of visits! :)"

Beers are overpriced but absolutely necessary to make it through the event.  Those combo deals that include beers and a game card seem like a good idea, until its 45 minutes later, youre out of points, youre nowhere near drunk and youve already spent $40. If you go late, try not to get syphilis when you walk by San Felipes."

There are a couple bars to sit at and they even open a big door to a bar for the outside too.  They have some good brews on tap and have flat screen tvs as well.   I have only had a burger and fries here.  They burger was really good, the fries were really greasy and were just okay. The staff here is friendly & speedy.  I would recommend this place for a good place for someone looking for a nice place to grab a drink and converse."

1,"My rating is based on the fact that as a vegetarian, they charge $8 for a small mediocre bean burrito.  Maybe if this bean burrito were exceptionally good or large in size, but it was neither.  Im not saying that if your idea of Mexican food is Chipolte, you will not find what you are looking for and be happy here. But if what you offer your vegetarian customers is deleting the meat and not adding anything else and charging full price, I can get MUCH BETTER elsewhere and pay way less.   GRINGOS:  Take off the Chipolte blindfolds!  Go to a real Mexican restaurant and see what real food is supposed to taste like!"

3,"I like the Thai Hut because it is safe Thai eating. They have some of the more adventurous authentic Thai, and then they have what I ALWAYS get - The Garden Delight with beef. Just basically vegetables and beef cooked in a marinade. They always have plenty of servers on hand and Ive never been disappointed. Theres just some little sparkle that it seems to be missing. I struggled between giving it a 3 or a 4, but I settled on a 3 because they could definitely improve the atmosphere a little bit and parking sucks. They are really close to the light rail now though, just get off at McDowell/Central and walk one block east on McDowell."

5,"Ah what a beauty and wonder Camelback mountain is. However I do warn beginners to use the easier trail on the East side near Invergorden which runs north south and turns into 64th st. It is a bit of a walk from the parking through the neighborhood but the hike is less treacherous and much easier and takes you up a gradual slope to the top. Be very careful its easy to loose the trail on that side too.  Of course all the Phoenicians like to go to Echo Canyon at Mcdonald and 44th street bend. Parking can be bad at peak times on weekends--I definetely recommend late afternoon hiking, less exhaustion from heat, less crowds and a glorious sunset at the top.  Happy Hiking my Dear Phoenicians."

I had the nachos once and they were quite filling and tasty.  Nice happy hour specials also.  I heard it was a place to watch Ohio State sports but it was pretty dead when I went there to watch a football game.  However, it was kind of nice getting a prime spot in front of a huge tv and the service was really good."

2,"Ive always said if the guacamole, chips and salsa arent good, the food is not likely to be good either.  I was right, Guacamole was not very good at all, same with the salsa.  Rest of the food was just okay but for a restaurant in the Biltmore I expected so much better.  Just as a note, when it comes to Mexican food, Im super critical.  This place will probably get a higher ratings from people of the Midwest."

Microwaved enchiladas, no rice, rude, cold, unfriendly, uninviting service...If youre looking for a fabulous, neighborhood mexican restaurant, try Las Glorias Grill. The location isnt as great, but the food, service and drinks, blows this place outta the water. After years of going to aunt chiladas, Im NEVER going back again. They dont deserve your money either...."

4,My wife and I ate here when we were in town for the B&J auto auction.  The food was good and affordable.  We liked the fact that they had a full bar and we were able to have a couple of tasty Margaritas.  Staff was friendly overall we had a good dining experience.

2,Dear God I should have ran to the hills when I walked in and saw 5 out of 5 people working there with electric shears in their hands. I refuse to call them stylists. I mean all I wanted was a trim for my 7 year old. Just a straight line. Id hate to see her take a sobriety test.

5,"Mmm!  Delicious Indian food and a great selection of vegetarian dishes. I LOVE the fact that each dish is mildly spiced, and left up to the individual to customize the flavor depending on which sauces they choose.  Im a spicy lightweight so it was great that I didnt have to worry about getting something too hot to enjoy. I had a bowl of brown rice, cumin potatoes and tofu masala with a cool yogurt-cucumber-mint sauce on the side.  It was fantastic!  I cant wait to go back. ...also, I thought it was adorable that we were given a golden dollar coin with our check for ""making the drive to their location and to compensate for high-gas prices"".  A memorable gesture!"

4,"I usually hate chains, especially Italian ones like Olive Garden and Romanos. But I was pleasantly surprised my Maggianos. We went because we got a gift card for Christmas but we are probably going back.  The bread and the dipping oil they start you out with is pretty good. I wish the dipping oil was just a little more seasoned though. My husband ordered the linguine and clams which he said was just ok. My stepson had the crab and shrimp cannelloni which he enjoyed. I really liked my eggplant Parmesan. It is the best egg parm I have had at a chain. The sauce is fresh tasting which huge chunks of garlic. One nice surprise is that our server said that my dish qualified for a free take home dish of the same category. So I ordered the gnocchi and had a nice dinner the next day."

4,"Eaten here a few times. Just finished lunch and had a great salad & sandwich. The salad I had was the spinach with poached egg, it was awesome. My taste is for savory, ""umami"", this was perfect with the egg bacon and light dressing. The chicken sandwich was good with basil and brie. Then the creme brulee with tahitian vanilla was great. Just a nice quaint place to sit outside and have a good lunch. One problem I have with Zinc Bistro is that they have Stella on tap, great right? But for $7! Thats one for $7. Come on, maybe $4. I just bought 12 for $10 at Total Wine."

I always get the chicken salad with sesame vinagrette on the side but I will say, Im not a fan of the pungent dressing.. I get the chile sauce instead.. vietnamese rolls.. and its not so unhealthy..

I cant say.. but for me its a strong 3.."

1,"if you like terrible service and overpriced food youve come to the right place.  If I knew before I went in there I would be paying $16.00 for macaroni and cheese, and had the pleasure of waiting around for an hour to get it, while my glass remained empty, I wouldve stayed away (which is what you should do).  Food wasnt awful, although 2 members of the party did cut up their mouths eating the hard as a ""Rock"" bread on their sandwiches. The mac n cheese was nothing special.  The service was beyond poor.  First and last time I will eat at Hard Rock Cafe."

1,"For frozen yogurt quality, I give this place a one. Honestly, its small, theres very little variety in terms of toppings, and the yogurt tastes cheap... Probably because its a big franchise. There is a reason why youre paying less for an ounce... Truly - you get what you pay for.  The concept is neat, sure, but if youre looking for pizzazz then you should try Yogurtini... Its just up the road from Yogurtland. Anyway, the single star says it all... ""Eek! Methinks not."""

1,"First off, the restaurant is dim and dark.. I thought the decor was a little off because they were going for a tropical Vietnam theme with banana trees in there and a waterfall fountain. The waiter there did not have a smile and didnt seem freindly, it looked like this was the last place he wanted to be at. The service sucked ass. I mean come on, there was only two tables including mines and 3.9/4 of the time, he didnt check up on us or refilled our water and we had to walk up to ask for our bill.. like seriously...? Are you that lazy. Bun Bo Hue was skimpy on the meat and had little veggies on the side. Pho had a rancid smell. Noodles in my sisters bun thit nuong were hard and watery (seemed like they were super old) Overall, I wouldnt recommend to ANYBODY."

2,"I have read several raving reviews of this place.  I was disappointed the first time so I went back again thinking I had an off experience.  I was still disappointed.  I had the carne torta the first time and the cubana the second.  The food was okay.  Not bad but not filling and not as good as some other places I can name off the top of my head.  The first time the torta came with chips and the 2nd time they came alone.  For 6 or 7 bucks Id expect a little more.  Here are a few places with much better tortas: Los Reyes De La Torta (7th st & Hatcher), El Gallo Blanco (Central & Indian), and El Nopalito (24th st and Thomas)."

4,"Ok reviewing the Waffle House is kinda lame, but here goes.  If you have lived in America at any point in the last 50 years you know they have good waffles and hash browns.  Is it the best breakfast option you could possibly encounter, well no.  Its just every once in awhile I find I just want Waffle House. ( Fond late night memories from college I would guess. )  It can be for breakfast, lunch, dinner, whenever. So what does this location have going for it that makes it better than the average Waffle House? 1. Lots of parking 2. Its not in a shady part of town 3. It has a really nice staff  4. They are fairly speedy 5. The restaurant is clean So there you go if you have a craving for waffles and hash browns then this is one of the better WH in the area."

I took a sip squeezed the lemon, and thought there was something wrong with the taste.  I checked and at first thought it was a lemon seed but no, sure enough it was a cricket (in which i took a picture).  The way this restaurant handled an insect in my water was repulsive.  One of the male bartenders came over and brought a new water saying, ""It happens.""  No, sorry thats disgusting.  If i hadnt been craving the volcano chicken I went there for I would have just left.  And then on top of getting a cricket in my water theres no discount or compensation off of my bill."

Granted, me and all the other people from my work were pretty loud after a sunday afternoon spring training game.  Maybe it was the girls being a little too giggly or us just having too much fun for a dive bar...but I think none of that warrants the bartender calling us cheap and rude.  Come on now, we are all servers and we all tipped you well.  Whats with the attitude?  Will still continue to come to this place once I stave off the embarrassment of telling people from work I know about this cool bar only to be so rudely treated by a way too snobby for a sunday afternoon bartender."

I should have gone a couple of miles over and bought Krispy Kreme. Krispy Kreme donuts are always fresh. These ones were worst that those that sat on the shelf for a week in a supermarket!

3,Met up with a group of friends here on a Monday night... a big group. Although Keegans had no notice of our mob arrival they did well with service etc. Beers were poured fast; food took a little extra time but with a group our size that is to be expected. The outside patio space was great on a warm AZ night... a friend got the sliders and said they were quite tasty when they finally arrived. The happy hour prices are okay with a nice choice of beers and mixed cocktails.

Need more options to get there, and where to park the car so that the trail can actually be enjoyed.  I will save my time and go elsewhere. Suggestion:  Should consider developing an offsite parking area, and providing a shuttle to the entrance (perhaps for a small fee)...and let it be known where to find the shuttle."

When did your service start sucking? Hey every person that decided that my two top was not important enough to attend! Why did it take 10 minutes to order my drink and then an additional ten minutes to actually get my drink? By the way, Tiger beer is on your menu.

Well, I didnt read the fined fingerprint and it was only for the last Thursday of every month.

When the pumps are full of cars, its hard to maneuver in and around the parking lot. The store looks a bit short on supplies, but then again I just went inside to pay.  I may give it another try, well see.  But Ill look elsewhere first."

5,"Id love to give this place MORE than 5 stars!!! In Phoenix a few weeks ago I needed to planb a nice dinner for a group of 10.  I thought about a few places and wanted to come here because of the view.  (Get it? Different Point of View.....?) Anyway, while I did initially pick DPOV because of the view, I fell in love with the perfect service AND the perfect menu. There were great options for my picky group, and not one person left unhappy, or hungry.  In addition, they seem to have a pre-fix menu with a nice price tag if youre ballin on a budget.   Everything was AMAZING and its definitely one of my favorite restaurants in DC!"

1,"This was the most HORRIBLE floor cleaning I have ever seen!!!!! We took before and after pictures and cannot tell the difference at all! The guy was not friendly and just wanted our money even though he did not do his job! I would NEVER recommend this company to anyone. We paid $1000 and got $20 worth of service. I mopped the floor the day after the cleaning guy was here and got a lot of the ""staining as he would say"" off easily. I have included a picture that we wrote in the floor with a paper towel after the cleaning....can you read the saying? That is exctaly how we felt after the service. REALLY?!?!?"

4,"This place has been around forever. I started coming here when I was 5 or 6, especially when my grandpa came to town from Cincinnati. He loved it.  The whole ""wild west"" theme prevails, and it is fun to think about cowboys and times gone by. I liked the sasparilla when I was a kid, I dont think Ive ever had it anywhere else.  Last time I was in Phoenix we went again, and while the quality of the food has maybe slid a bit since I was 5 ( um, Im kinda a LOT older now), it is still cool. I like the good mood of all the visitors, its a place that inspires laughter and happy shared experience.  If you do wear a tie, wear one you dont care about, ok. Trust me on this."

1,"We came here for dinner for me and reverse happy hour for my wife, we ordered our appetizers and after finishing them and looking over the menu for a few minutes we were ready to jump into the overpriced entrees. We were then informed that we couldnt order dinner. Maybe when they see someone coming in and telling them they are...here for dinner...they might give them a heads up that the kitchen Is closing so we can order our meals and not be told five minutes after it did close..fourth time weve given this place a and got crappy service. Bartender got a buck tip and we had to go find another restaurant for dinner, Needless to say we wont be giving them another chance. Not good Gordon B. Not good."

2,"Would normally give this place 4 stars as I have been a regular here for about a year.  Cheap drinks, great crowd and great music. Except I had my first bad experience here the other sunday.  Granted, me and all the other people from my work were pretty loud after a sunday afternoon spring training game.  Maybe it was the girls being a little too giggly or us just having too much fun for a dive bar...but I think none of that warrants the bartender calling us cheap and rude.  Come on now, we are all servers and we all tipped you well.  Whats with the attitude?  Will still continue to come to this place once I stave off the embarrassment of telling people from work I know about this cool bar only to be so rudely treated by a way too snobby for a sunday afternoon bartender."

1,Was I there on a bad day or what?  I showed up 15 minutes after they opened and EVERY item I tried was either luke warm or cold.    They have 15+ items on the lunch buffet and I tried a bite of all of them.   Gross and bland.   I felt sick to my stomach after I left because I kept thinking how bad the food was. Yuck!

4,"One of my new favorite neighborhood bars!  We had a Canada Day shindig here and its a great little neighborhood bar with fair drink prices and super friendly bar staff. Youd never know that theres a bar inside when you get to the parking lot behind the Ice Rink - just look for the signs on the top of the building.  They have lots of TVs for hockey fans and the bar looks right out onto the ice so you can watch people skate. They had a great jukebox and the Rockband kit so you can rock out with all your newest bar friends.  For food selection you have BBQ, BBQ, or BBQ...either beef, pork, or chicken, with a side for $6.50. Tasty stuff! Great beer selection including Molson Canadian or Labatt Blue."

2,"I personally will never eat there again. The chips are actually amazing though, I would eat those a lot if it didnt require me stpping foot in the ultimate bro/slut restaurant. The food is gross, the tortillas are ok, I like the decor actually, but the employees are slutty (and by slutty I saw skirts soo short if they picked something off the floor you for sure would see vagina) Apparently the uniform is jean skirts and heels. This is the male glittery shirt wearing capitol of Scottsdale. The food sucks, dont eat here!"

2,This Baja Fresh really didnt impress me.  Its pricey considering that all youre getting is meat in a tortilla.  It doesnt have that Mexican feel to it and is unoriginal.  There were bugs on the wall.  The food is good however.  Nothing special though.  Since its a corporate chain you cant expect sizzling flavor but I was left unsatisfied.  There are better Mexican food places to go to.

5,"We came here the weekend of the Grand Opening. I will say we were very impressed and  there was so much to choose from at this new and improved Pets Mart.  There is a Hotel here for Cats and Dogs. There is a Banner Pet hospital, and there is a Grooming station ,as well as a Dog training store as well. Talk about your one stop shopping. I even got to hold a beautiful baby girl Pug just 6 weeks old. She was absolutly adorable.   We took a picture but have not figured out how to download it yet. Nice and Clean all throughout the store . We purchased a few items and then we were on our way.  Lots of Parking in the lot. Plus nice clean human bathrooms."

2,"I read the two good reviews here on Yelp, so I was looking forward to a good Italian dinner.  Unfortunately, it must have been an off night.  The waitress didnt want to be bothered and the meatballs and the tomato sauce on the spaghetti didnt have much flavor.  Thats the test of a good Italian restaurant for me.  If the sauce is good, they usually get thumbs up.  This sauce wasnt ""bad,"" but it was bland and watery.  Even the bowl of spaghetti wasnt drained properly so there was a dripping, runny mess at the bottom of the paltry bowl of pasta.  This place is right around the corner from my house and Dominic is my brothers name!  So I was really disappointed."

2,"Absolutely, positively bitter. They use a powder in lieu of syrups which adds a after taste I dont care for. There was no color difference between my beverage (latte) and my friends (iced coffee). Why... I have no clue. We order these drinks everywhere and this has never happened before. I can see how a powder would be more cost effective but the taste was something I did not care for. Maybe that makes me a coffee snob, I am not sure."

2,"When I was younger and first moved to Arizona, Serranos on Rural Road became a family tradition to get mexican food. It was basically all I knew till adulthood. If I would have reviewed this place 10 years ago, it would have been 5 stars but now the blinders are off and I have money to try better places. One by one they all seem to dwarf Serranos in most every way. I feel kinda guilty writing this and hope my family does not read this :) But it has to be said. I would still eat at Serranos but it doesnt have the same feeling anymore. The Chimichangas are good and their bean dip is awesome. Nothing I have had is gross or anything but its just   basic greasy mexican food. There are better places out there. Once again to any family reading this....Im sorry :)"

We recommended it to others as well.  Showed up on a Tuesday night for dinner and everything was packed up....?  A little searching on the web (Facebook, specifically) shows that theyre done.  What a shame."

2,This pizza always tasted great but lately I feel like they have cheapened their ingredients. I realize its $5 pizza but it just tastes different to me now. If it werent for the flavored crust I would not come back.  But the main reason I have not returned to Hungry Howies is because the last time I wanted to place a pick up order I was turned down. I asked for a reason and was told that they received a very large company order and they were not taking regular orders at that moment.  Youd think they would be able to accommodate everyone even if a large order was placed.

There are never any helpful people, nothing is labeled properly, and the fabric counter is always a nightmare.  This one is tolerable because no one is ever here.

A little cheese too.  And a sliver or two of peppers.  But mostly, it was bread.  I think its funny the people that work here try to make small talk with you.  ""So, what are you guys up to tonight?""  I think it would be fun to just try and f*#k with them, and say something like, ""Oh you know, smoking a little meth and just chilling with some hookers.""

Also Shepard pie we ordered had extra ingredients such as zuccini, so they should have warned us about not being a proper Shepard pie.  Gordon Ramsay would have been mad.  Service was good. Only saving grace."

I dont drink coffee... a terrible character fault, I know... but Gina and her partner are wonderful hosts and have made a cozy little space to serve delicious food and drinks (I get the chai tea with soy milk.) I like that computers are no where to be seen, only happy people eating and drinking and enjoying conversation. This is a lovely little place, a gem. I enjoy every visit. It is especially nice to bring new people in that havent been before (so invite a friend to brunch because it is a nice surprise.) The service is great, the food is made fresh, and everything Ive tried is delicious, even my five year old loved her nutella on toast. Good things come in small packages and toast illustrates this perfectly."

Of course you can always get the lunch portion which is smaller, but then you dont have the extra goodies for later!   Its a small down home place, dress comfy and go there to eat up!  The wait staff is always the best and they know their stuff!   Ive had their T-Bone here, and its good, but really hard to go there and not get what made them famous!  Wonderful food! Prices for lunch are around $7.00 and dinner around $12.00 - really hard to beat for real down home cooking!"

1,"I had such high expectaions after reading reviews but I was so disappointed.  The food was not good, the service was awful.  They got all of our orders mixed upo. Will never go back and cannot recommend this place.  PS  one dish was good and some enjoyed the soup.  There are 100 places I will visit before returning to this place."

Dont order mixed drinks, dont order wine, both are gross unless your sole purpose is to get trashed, which is the mission of every underage and young, young 20-something at this bar. This is the place youd go to with your fake ID because when youre 19 this is what you think a bar should be. Expect people over drinking and throwing up very early on in the evening in the bathroom."

3,"Moved here from San Francisco, and have been searching  for decent Chinese food.  Flos has been our standby, but we tried Jade Palace on recommendations of our midwestern snowbird friends. I can only comment on the food, as we ordered take out.  Our order was ready in 15 minutes and it was complete.   I had Chow Fun, and it was the equivalent to Flos, Ok, but not spectacular, and a lot more oily.  Husband had Mongolian Beef and said that Flos was better, but the meat tasted fresher on the Jade Palace version.  Jade Palace is much closer to us, so I will try their Hot and Sour soup in the fall, which is usually the barometer I use to measure Chinese Food.  Go figure, we are now hoping for some San Francisco restaurants to relocate to Scottsdale."

Jade Palaces is much tighter to us, so I will try their Hottest and Sour soup in the fall, which is usually the barometer I use to measure Chinese Food.

1,"Do not get your oil changed at this walmart or any walmart. We got a oil change and they dented our oil pan and now it leaks and they are not taking responsibility for the damages they caused. I have only had my oil changed for the last year here and they are trying to put it off on someone else, when no one else has clearly done our oil. The insurance for walmart wont even look at my vehicle and had already decided they are not at fault. I had a 3rd party appraiser look at it and they can only determine it was from an oil change. I have no other option but to take this to a lawyer."

1,This was absolutely horrible. I got the supreme pizza with the mystery meats.  I threw it in the trash. I will wait until I get to my destination to eat. Horrible!!!

2,"Drinking + Arcade Games. This should be an obvious winner, right? Wrong. Oh, how wrong.  Eating here is like eating in a casino, only less classy and with worse food.  Beers are overpriced but absolutely necessary to make it through the event.  Those combo deals that include beers and a game card seem like a good idea, until its 45 minutes later, youre out of points, youre nowhere near drunk and youve already spent $40. If you go late, try not to get syphilis when you walk by San Felipes."

3,"As far as basic burgers go this is an OK option. The flavor is ok and basic toppings give everyone enough choice. Better than McDonalds yeah and similar to In-n-Out but nothing really special. Price is not cheap for a burger so I would expect a little more, but not more fries because they give you a bucket full and more."

5,"Thanks to Yelp I was able to find this hidden jewel.  The place looks like a spanish style motel converted into a restaurant.  With a cute garden in the back.  I had already eaten so didnt intend on a 2nd breakfast.  But stingy GF only allowed me a few bites so I had to ask Chris to whip up  another plate for me.   It was my first time having chilled salmon done that way and it was so good.  Everything tasted so fresh.   For the price you get to drink all you want.  And I must have had at least 10 glasses of the orange juice with mixed berries.   The food and the atmosphere reminds me of eating in Napa, CA.   Will definitely return when Im in town."

5,"What a beautiful hotel! The Clarendon is truly one of a kind. The staff goes above and beyond to make sure you have everything you need...and extras :) The pool area is gorgeous and the atmosphere is delightful. I had the opportunity to meet the owner, Ben Bethel. What an astonishing young man he is! I dont know which is more impressive, his efforts to make the hotel as ""green"" as possible or the fact that he helps guests with their bags as they walk through the door. I cant wait for another excuse to stay at the Clarendon again!"

1,"Lots of ""gay on gay"" homophobia here.  Hick bars in Alabama are more gay friendly.  Staff and owners know this but they do not seem to care.  Oh well"

1,"Every time Ive been there they have messed up my order in some way. The first time I ordered a sonic blast w Carmel. They charged me for Carmel but there was none in it plus the bottom of the cup was busted and my ice cream was leaking out. The next I went I ordered a reese sonic blast and a snickers, they were both snickers. Very upset I havent been back and I love that place."

5,"This is the most progressive, inclusive, welcoming, diverse, intellectually stimulating, public-service oriented church in the Valley, if not the West Coast.  Weve been to more than a few and can attest to that.   Pastor Jeff not only knows everyones name but is genuinely concerned about everything that goes on in your life.  The congregation is like one big family.  Love for your neighbors is not just a commandment at this church - its acted upon.   If youre sick of churches that tell you what to believe in and dont act what they preach, youd better check this one out.  Services every Sunday at 9:30am."

1,"We found a bandaid with the panang.  We ordered panang with chicken, not panang with bandaid.  When we told the waiter, he argued that it wasnt a bandaid.  Im sorry, theres no mistaking a bandaid!  The icing on the cake was that they charged us for it!!! If you like bandaid on your dish, this I the place to go! Too bad yelp doesnt allow 0 stars. This place definitely was a ZERO."

2,"I heard nothing but praise about the food and atmosphere of this chain restaurant.  I loved the look of this place inside and out. Great rustic barrels and old barber chairs in the bar area gave a unique look. Service was friendly and fast.  Food was less than desirable. Salad was nothing but iceberg lettuce (and I got a stump) with some shredded red cabbage. My pasta dish was spaghetti with a white clam sauce. It was too salty and there was a sprinkling of microscopic clam bits.  I always take leftovers home, this time I didnt. While the prices are good its not worth a less than average meal. Husband was equally disappointed with his chicken marsala. Chances of going back are slim to none."

1,"Just had Daphnes for the last time. In the 3 times that we have ordered from them, they cannot seem to get a simple order right. One Kids Burger with Apple Slices (Nope) one side of hummus(Nope) But they are quick to charge you for the order. Then you call and talk to a girl name Liz and she begins to tell you that they are correct and you the customer are wrong. Even though I have all the food sitting in front of me nope still no kids burger or side of hummus. HMMMMM,.. keep letting her answer the phone and you will see your to go customer base decline. We are an office in Scottsdale that everyday is ordering lunch for the office, Daphnes has officially been removed from the menu book. Nice customer service!!!!!!"

5,"There are many places in the valley and its surrounding cities to eat Mexican food; however, there is one and only La Canasta. In the last two years the boyfriend and I have eaten at this restaurant location quite often. For the money, you get exactly what you pay for: a decent meal and generous portions. The chips and salsa are ever-flowing and the salsa is some of the best Ive tasted. The wait staff are generally pleasant, attentive and very accommodating. Plus they frequently recall what you had during your previous visits. I recommend you try the Machaca dinner or my boyfriends favorite dish, the number 5 lunch special. There are multiple locations in the valley, but this one beats them all hands down."

3,This theatre is very conveniently located in the Arrowhead mall which of course makes parking a breeze. It isnt my favorite in town because there always seem to be tons of teenagers here (im sure BECAUSE it is in the mall) and yes I know if they are too loud then we are too old. In any case the theatres are busy and bustling. The concessions seem very high but I guess that is a trade-off for the convenience.

3,"Its three stars because I dont know how to rate it -- I didnt think it was very good at all when I went the other night during their grand opening, but maybe I just dont have a taste for it.  Service was prompt and polite.  The food?  Eh.  I had one of the house specials.  I didnt think it was very special.  I do think the waiter deserves bonus points for talking me into a half order rather than a full order.  The lemon-lime beverage was strong and sweet."

4,"I had expected this place to be a rather small museum, but it is actually quite large and is packed with artifacts and pieces from Native American tribes.  During our visit, we took a tour given by a Navajo student.  He was very knowledgeable and definitely kept everyones attention with the information that he provided.  With the amount of exhibits on display in this museum, you can easily spend two or three hours just taking in everything that is offered.  There is a wide range of items on display from dolls to paintings to glass work to clothing and jewelry.  Another cool thing is that this museum allows you to photograph anything that you want."
