2,"I got the banana nutella cupcake and adored the bananas bread-like cupcake. However, the frosting is way too sweet and overpowers the banana fragrance of the cupcake. As many reviewers have already mentioned, the cupcake is moreover over-priced at $3.75 each for the size and the lack of creativity.  With so numerous desert/snack locations in Scottsdale, I am unlikely to come back here."

I dont yet like Salmon and theirs is good. Alright salad bar and salads ( pasta, tuna etc..) The pizza and sushi.. again surprising!! And........ they have about 10 different iced teas to choose from. Also, they have a marvelous breakfast. Omelet station and all. I suggest the chorizo and egg burritos. RESPLENDENT outdoors patio"

5,"The message I received was drip is toast. I dont drink coffee... a terrible character fault, I know... but Gina and her partner are wonderful hosts and have made a cozy little space to serve delicious food and drinks (I get the chai tea with soy milk.) I like that computers are no where to be seen, only happy people eating and drinking and enjoying conversation. This is a lovely little place, a gem. I enjoy every visit. It is especially nice to bring new people in that havent been before (so invite a friend to brunch because it is a nice surprise.) The service is great, the food is made fresh, and everything Ive tried is delicious, even my five year old loved her nutella on toast. Good things come in small packages and toast illustrates this perfectly."

Given, me and all the other people from my work were pretty loud after a sunday afternoon springtime training game.  Maybe it was the girls being a petite too giggly or us just having too much fun for a dive bar...but I think no of that warrants the bartender calling us cheap and insolent.

2,"Drinking + Arcade Games. This should be an obvious winner, right? Wrong. Oh, how wrong.  Eating here is like eating in a casino, only less classy and with worse food.  Beers are overpriced but absolutely necessary to make it through the event.  Those combo deals that include beers and a game card seem like a good idea, until its 45 minutes later, youre out of points, youre nowhere near drunk and youve already spent $40. If you go late, try not to get syphilis when you walk by San Felipes."
2,"I got the banana nutella cupcake and adores the banana bread-like cupcake. Though, the ice is camino too sweet and overpowers the banana flavor of the cupcake. As many reviewers have already mentioned, the cupcake is also over-priced at $3.75 each for the size and the imperfection of imaginative.  With so many desert/snack places in Scottsdale, I am unlikely to come back here."

3,"I finally tried Spicy Pickle last week. I like the name and was intrigued about their menu. Paninis, soups, salads, pizzetas, nothing out of the ordinary. I had a half sandwich ( Sausalito Bandido?), half salad combo ( Spinach salad). Food was fresh and good. The sandwich could have stand a little more meat, it was truly flat. The salad was crisp and dressing was on the side, which I appreciated.   On my way out I got a chocolate chip cookie that was OK. I love cookies and they have to be pretty bad for me not to like them. This one, I kid you not, must have had maybe 3-4 chocolate chips? So if youre craving chocolate, this is not the cookie for you."

I was hesitant to eat here but was so hungry and saw that they had my fav dishes, sinigang and diniguan. They were both ok, Ive def had better. I ordered the pancit for my husband and it was terrible! He had maybe two bites and threw the rest away.  Oh well, wont be coming back here. Theres another filipino place in Phoenix so well be trying that next. Gingeroot, also in Chandler, is way better but expensive. Guess its worth the price when you have your cravings!"

My stylist, Delia, ran 45 minutes late to start me, and on several occasions during the hair cut, stopped and kept looking around.  She made various odd faces as if to say my hair was a mess.  She not only didnt listen to what I wanted, but shot down the only thing I did ask for.  She said I wouldnt look good.  At the end of the painful ordeal, she then charged me for a conditioning service I didnt ask for.  At that point she directed me to the line at the front of the store, after which I waited in, they then sent me back to the salon to make the price correction.  (happened twice, then I asked for a manager)  Was very unprofessional all around and would NEVER go back!!!"

5,"I ADORE this place. Matts has been a staple breakfast, brunch, whatever place for me since I moved to Downtown 5 years ago. They just moved to a great place up the street (where Verde used to be for locals) with more room so now everything isnt so crammed! Not that we all didnt enjoy their original house, this one just says, ""Im still awesome, I just stepped up a notch."" Everything is delicious. I love their 5 Spot, the waffles are great, and their lunch specials are always amazing. If you like jelly - try their homemade stuff. Try the bacon."

As many reviewers have already mentioned, the cupcake is also over-priced at $3.75 each for the size and the lack of creativity.  With so many desert/snack places in Scottsdale, I am unlikely to come back here."

Maybe when they see someone coming in and telling them they are...here for brunch...they conceivably give them a heads up that the cook Is shuts so we can decree our meals and not be told five minutes after it did shuts..fourth time weve given this place a and got shit service. Bartender got a buck tip and we had to go find another restaurant for dinner, Ineffectual to say we wont be conferring them another likelihood. Not good Gordon B. Not good."
1,"We came here for lunches for me and inversion joyful hour for my mujer, we ordered our appetizers and after finishing them and researching over the menu for a few minutes we were ready to jump into the overpriced entrees. We were then informed that we couldnt order dinner. Maybe when they see someone coming in and telling them they are...here for dining...they potentially give them a leiter up that the galley Is closing so we can order our eating and not be told five minutes after it did close..fourth time weve given this place a and got shite service. Bartender got a buck tip and we had to go find another restaurant for breakfast, Needless to say we wont be giving them another chance. Not good Gordon B. Not well."
2,"Would normally give this place 4 stars as I have been a regular here for about a year.  Cheap drinks, great crowd and great music. Except I had my first bad experience here the other sunday.  Granted, me and all the other people from my work were pretty loud after a sunday afternoon spring training game.  Maybe it was the girls being a little too giggly or us just having too much fun for a dive bar...but I think none of that warrants the bartender calling us cheap and rude.  Come on now, we are all servers and we all tipped you well.  Whats with the attitude?  Will still continue to come to this place once I stave off the embarrassment of telling people from work I know about this cool bar only to be so rudely treated by a way too snobby for a sunday afternoon bartender."
