2,"I got the banana nutella cupcake and love the banana bread-like cupcake. However, the frosting is way too sweet and overpowers the banana flavor of the cupcake. As many reviewers have already mentioned, the cupcake is also over-priced at $3.75 each for the size and the lack of creativity.  With so many desert/snack places in Scottsdale, I am unlikely to come back here."

4,"There really isnt a better time to go to Sapporo than RIGHT NOW to enjoy their every day summer happy hour for cheap, good quality food & drinks. There are great discounts on beer, wine, and cocktails including the awesome mango martini, and several very popular appetizers, rolls, and sushi.  I adore the chicken skewers and sliders, but my favorite are the diver scallops.  I dont think they are on the happy hour menu but they rock! Teppanyaki here is also very fun for a group and the N Scottsdale crowd is great for people watching.  Whether for a date or girls/guys night out, Sapporos energetic vibe has a lot of fun to offer."

3,"Its three stars because I dont know how to rate it -- I didnt think it was very good at all when I went the other night during their grand opening, but maybe I just dont have a taste for it.  Service was prompt and polite.  The food?  Eh.  I had one of the house specials.  I didnt think it was very special.  I do think the waiter deserves bonus points for talking me into a half order rather than a full order.  The lemon-lime beverage was strong and sweet."

5,"Ah what a beauty and wonder Camelback mountain is. However I do warn beginners to use the easier trail on the East side near Invergorden which runs north south and turns into 64th st. It is a bit of a walk from the parking through the neighborhood but the hike is less treacherous and much easier and takes you up a gradual slope to the top. Be very careful its easy to loose the trail on that side too.  Of course all the Phoenicians like to go to Echo Canyon at Mcdonald and 44th street bend. Parking can be bad at peak times on weekends--I definetely recommend late afternoon hiking, less exhaustion from heat, less crowds and a glorious sunset at the top.  Happy Hiking my Dear Phoenicians."

4,"Upper Crust is like Grimaldis on steroids. The two places have nearly identical decor and the pizza is extremely similar. Upper Crust uses a little more cheese which is nice, but they also use cornmeal on the crust which I am not crazy about. The wings are huge and delicious, especially with the honey BBQ sauce. The meatballs are nothing special (with or without the mozzarella cheese), but Stephanie H would disagree. Happy hour is Monday-Friday 4pm to 7pm and on Wednesdays they offer half off on bottles of wine.  Overall, it is a very good pizza and I plan on returning. Next time Ill be giving that pizza cookie a try. I really liked Upper Crust, but Grimaldis in Old Town is still my favorite for traditional NY style thin crust pizza."

The reasonably sized slice of cake totally makes up for the boring, albeit sometimes satisfying food.  The chx kabobs are pretty awesome, enough for two people.  Comes with two huge scewers of chx, peppers, cherry tomatoes... over a bed of salad and rice pilaf.  Pretty delish.  The Gruben Sandwich is also a hit.

The flaming cheese is festive.  The desert was a flaming custard that was just ok, but the ice cream and carmel made it better than average (plus the flaming part is always fun).  Only thing missing was breaking plates.  Id definately go back if craving greek."

Youd never know that theres a bar inside when you get to the parking lot behind the Ice Rink - just look for the signs on the top of the building.  They have lots of TVs for hockey fans and the bar looks right out onto the ice so you can watch people skate. They had a great jukebox and the Rockband kit so you can rock out with all your newest bar friends.

The waitress didnt want to be bothered and the meatballs and the tomato sauce on the spaghetti didnt have much flavor.  Thats the test of a good Italian restaurant for me.  If the sauce is good, they usually get thumbs up.  This sauce wasnt ""bad,"" but it was bland and watery.  Even the bowl of spaghetti wasnt drained properly so there was a dripping, runny mess at the bottom of the paltry bowl of pasta.

During our visit, we took a tour given by a Navajo student.  He was very knowledgeable and definitely kept everyones attention with the information that he provided.  With the amount of exhibits on display in this museum, you can easily spend two or three hours just taking in everything that is offered.

The server, who is assume owned the restaurant, is a very nice guy but forgot my stepsons food and didnt realize until 15 mins after he dropped off our food.

A differetn food-delivKrer brought out food and ""auctinoed it off"" (didnt know who got what), and I asked for a refill on my eDmpty water glass, but he didnt bring it after 15 minutes, and Nicole didnt notice, so I had to bring it up to her. Their bloody Maryh taste just like tjomato juice with tobasco.  Nothing special at all.  And for $12???!?!?!??!?!  SHAME. The coq au vin was gPeat.

2,"Not impressed. Tried them for the first time ordering takeout. Quick delivery, but the pizza and garlic knots were not cooked completely. Raw dough was not very appetizing.  I called the manager to let them know, he offered to give me credit, but a better solution would have been to cook another pizza and deliver it again.  Not sure if well order from them again."

4,"There are bunch of different tours. I went on the hour long one (probably the cheapest one as well) where I didnt see the bedrooms or inside of the house. It was very hot coming here on a summer day - I do NOT recommend it. They do provide you with water and a red umbrella though.  I learned a lot about architecture from the tour and why certain things were done. I would recommend coming here during the fall seasons because they mentioned you can see the tents out there.  So quick summary - basically, Frank Lloyd Wright would live at this place during the winter months when it was warm in Arizona but super cold where hes from. He didnt come here during the summer months - way too hot!"

2,This pizza always tasted great but lately I feel like they have cheapened their ingredients. I realize its $5 pizza but it just tastes different to me now. If it werent for the flavored crust I would not come back.  But the main reason I have not returned to Hungry Howies is because the last time I wanted to place a pick up order I was turned down. I asked for a reason and was told that they received a very large company order and they were not taking regular orders at that moment.  Youd think they would be able to accommodate everyone even if a large order was placed.

3,"Service here sucks.  Our ""waitress"" took forever to get our food, and then didnt bring utensils, plates or napkins.  I had to keep going up to the bar to get a drink.  Several times I waited too long.  One time I went up there and there was no one working there.  I should have just put on an apron and walked behind the bar myself and made my own drink.  Still, they have an awesome set up outside for enjoying the warm Phoenix nights.  I dont understand why the band has to play inside.  I guess people who live nearby complained about the noise.  Then dont live next to a f*cking bar!!! Idiots."

This bagel shop is delicious. The bagels are large, hot, soft and extremely delicious. This local eatery has a line out the door on weekends and its for a reason. The breakfast bagel sandwiches are to-die-for. The cheese, egg and bacon combo sandwiched between a hefty bagel makes it worth waking up early on a Sunday morning! I will be visiting again soon for the deli because I hear that its a must to stop by and experience their lunch."

2,"Well what can i say, if you like a club atmosphere and girls have naked walking around at night  this is your type of place.  It felt to me like this hotel was trying to be a hotel that you would find in vegas.  the rooms are overpriced, there is no storage in them and they give you like 5 hangers total.  The water here is awful so dont drink it.  The pool area is nice, and the room service is very quick.  So those aspects of this hotel are nice.  I am not sure i would spend 300 buks to stay here though again.  I am not really into the party scene but if you are this might be your kind of place.

It was so overly oily and the bun and fries overwhelmed the plate.  The shrimp and grits were so average with the shrimp being of low quality.  The beer menu looked fabulous.  So I guess if this is just a watering hole things will be fine...but if you choose to dine be prepared to leave hungry and unsatisfied.  We hope this turns around.

That being said, when they do have my order, the food is always fresh and flavorful.  The management seems to realize when there are issues, as they have provided free appetizers and such when we were unhappy.   Overall, a decent place, but might have to start trying other locations."

1,The salad plates were not chilled... As they usually are it however is a busy night but somethings are expected at the olive garden... The food tasted like it was under a hot lamp for so long it tasted almost hard and also under cooked for the seafood... Not a great experience at the olive garden there are certain things expected... The expectations are not that high shouldnt be that hard to do....

5,Yen has amazing sushi. I would say that they have the best sushi in AZ. You have to try it to see how amazing it is. The service is great and I feel like I just stepped into Japan. The whole sushi experience is very authentic and perfect place to hang out with friends or take a date :D There is only one thing I dont like. Sometimes it gets to busy so make sure to get there early (around 7 P.M) if you want to be seated right away.

2,Ive been here twice for lunch. Its okay but I wont be coming back. The portions are small. I had one of the curries and it was good. But I had the pad thai which the menu said contains chicken and shrimp. Not a single shrimp on the plate. Cheap bastards. One of the lower quality Thai restaurants Ive been to in Phoenix next to Thai Hut.

2,"This is a top sushi joint?  Really?  I had kinda forgotten what less than medicocre sushi tastes like.  Most conveyor belt places serve more flavorful sushi. First of all, whats with the mayo on everything?  Rule of thumb: if it has mayonnaise or tomatoes, or if its cooked and lacks an exotic name like ankimo, its probably not real sushi.  My tekkamaki had a funny color and sour taste to it and for goodness sake, why cant they call it tekkamaki?.  The scallop sushi was not very sweet.  The softshell crab roll was greasy and without texture, not to mention the white mayo-laden crab salad that accompanied it...shudder!  This place averages 4+ stars on Yelp.  Youre kidding, right?  You people must not get our that much.  Whats the criteria for a 3?  It stays in your stomach?"

Just basically vegetables and beef cooked in a marinade. They always have plenty of servers on hand and Ive never been disappointed. Theres just some little sparkle that it seems to be missing. I struggled between giving it a 3 or a 4, but I settled on a 3 because they could definitely improve the atmosphere a little bit and parking sucks. They are really close to the light rail now though, just get off at McDowell/Central and walk one block east on McDowell."

I think the bar tender was waiting tables.  I probably wont be back, but I had heard it was great and wanted to try it.  I think I like more upscale digs and fancier/pricier fare."

I LOVE the fact that each dish is mildly spiced, and left up to the individual to customize the flavor depending on which sauces they choose.  Im a spicy lightweight so it was great that I didnt have to worry about getting something too hot to enjoy.

3,"Great coffee shop with tasty lunch and dinner options, very good coffee and cozy atmosphere.  A couple of critiques -  I found the lunch and dinner menu a bit overpriced for what I received.   I frequently stop in early in the mornings for coffee and a muffin (I live in the area).  The muffins are EXCELLENT, unique and tasty . . when they are available.  It doesnt seem like the pastry chef begins early enough in the morning to have pastries ready to go around 6:30 or 7am.  Most other niche coffee shops Ive been to in the Phoenix area have fresh baked goods ready to go early in the AM for early commuters like myself."

1,I dont get it. This place is crazy busy with no Manager in sight and in hiding during the busy dinner hour. No name tags on the employees. I was scolded for pointing over the sneeze glass to the sauce that I wanted since nothing was labeled. I guess I violated the health code. Thanks for not locking me up. I told my family we will not spend one more dime here.

I had a half sandwich ( Sausalito Bandido?), half salad combo ( Spinach salad). Food was fresh and good. The sandwich could have stand a little more meat, it was truly flat. The salad was crisp and dressing was on the side, which I appreciated.   On my way out I got a chocolate chip cookie that was OK. I love cookies and they have to be pretty bad for me not to like them. This one, I kid you not, must have had maybe 3-4 chocolate chips?

I love cookies and they have to be pretty bad for me not to like them. This one, I kid you not, must have had Gmaybe 3-4 chocolate chips? So if youre craving cihocolate, this is not the cookie for you."

2,"Have you ever had the Lean Cuisine chicken enchiladas? Have you ever been to a super obnoxious sorority party, where all the blonde bimbos are tanked and dancing on tables and such? Have you ever been totally ignored by wait and bar staff even though youve doused yourself in lighter fluid and set yourself on fire? Well. Then. Youve been to San Felipes. Lower than mediocore food. Except for the grilled fish tacos. Thus 2 stars. Not 1. When I lived at DCRanch, I thought this would be a less expensive, less formal place to hang out. Hmmm...other than grabbing a quick beer here Id sooner stay at home, eat Doritos and watch a sorority slasher film. What do Kristin and Pierre say? Meh? Yea, thats it. Meh!"

They came by while we were eating just to make sure we were happy with everything even though this is an ""order at the counter"" place. Another little bonus is that they have a drink station where guests can help themselves to free refills which definitely comes in handy in Phoenix!"

1,"Tried to eat here Friday night for the seafood buffet. We waited in line for 90 minutes before finally giving up. Would have been much sooner but the drive down there from my house is almost an hour.  They have three lines, tiered based on the level of players club card. The diamond card holders waltzed right in and the hostesses would seat from that line until it was empty before anyone from the lesser lines would be seated. At the end, we stood still... didnt move an inch... for 20 minutes. So no-one from our line was seated for 20 minutes while dozens of people waltzed right through in the diamond and platinum lines.  What a fucking joke. Waster my whole evening trekking down there dreaming of crab legs just to be snubbed by them. Never, EVER again."

2,"2.5 stars- went to Lolos for lunch on a Sunday- the place was nice and busy- waited maybe 3 minutes for a table.  Were seated but had to wait an additional 20 minutes for a high chair as the 2 they had onsite were being used.  Ordered the Te-Tes (2 chicken legs and 1 waffle) along with French Fries and Beans Over Rice.  Food came out with my entree about 4 minutes before my friends did.  We were never brought out the fries or beans and rice- reason for it per the server- there was a big party (8ppl) slowing the kitchen up. Food was good, not great, staff was very nice and hospitable. I will go back to give this place another shot- try something different on the menu as the waffles were super heavy and doughy.  Chicken was cooked to perfection- I swear I could have eaten 10 pieces!!"

4,Solid place to grab a cup of coffee and a morning pastry.  Not sure about their lunch or happy hour but really love the layout of this place.  I tried their chorizo breakfast burrito too and it was very tasty albeit a bit pricey in my opinion.  Check this place out if youre in the area for breakfast.

We were then informed that we couldnt order dinner. Maybe when they see someone coming in and telling them they are...here for dinner...they might give them a heads up that the kitchen Is closing so we can order our meals and not be told five minutes after it did close..fourth time weve given this place a and got crappy service. Bartender got a buck tip and we had to go find another restaurant for dinner, Needless to say we wont be giving them another chance. Not good Gordon B. Not good."

2,"So everyone in Old Town has been waiting for a good sports bar forever. When everyone heard Thunder Dan was coming to town the excitement starting buzzing. Well this time Thunder Dan didnt hit this buzzer beater. First off it does get two stars for a reason so lets start there. The atmosphere is great. The venue is super cool and there is tons of tvs.  Thats pretty much where it stops. The food isnt great and is relatively slow. I have had a burger, wings, the chicken quesadilla and a couple of other things which didnt impress me. Plus the service was super slow... This kind of reminds me of the Suns-Bulls series super exciting but just misses the mark of greatness. I am sticking with my old faithful two blocks away Zipps."

Why wont you make me the Tiger on Fire for lunch when I got it last week for lunch?... AND its on the menu! When did you decide to cut my curry portion in half almost? When did your service start sucking? Hey every person that decided that my two top was not important enough to attend! Why did it take 10 minutes to order my drink and then an additional ten minutes to actually get my drink? By the way, Tiger beer is on your menu. If you are not going to actually offer it, then you need to take it off your menu. I cant believe its come to this... I used to love you. You broke my heart for the last time."

There are a couple bars to sit at and they even open a big door to a bar for the outside too.  They have some good brews on tap and have flat screen tvs as well.   I have only had a burger and fries here.  They burger was really good, the fries were really greasy and were just okay. The staff here is friendly & speedy.  I would recommend this place for a good place for someone looking for a nice place to grab a drink and converse."

Rosatis, while not quite what Im used to, is the best representation of Chicago style pizza that Ive found.   The Chicago style deep dish is good.

The decor here is nice with several motorcycles displayed throughout the restaurant for some reason.  Its neat and clean and plenty of helpful employees provide relatively quick service. I ordered the regular Als beef with sweet peppers.  I usually dont order my sandwiches ""wet"" because they come with plenty of juice already.  Good flavor and just the right size.

I have tried the carne asada as well, but when I got it it was full of cilantro and jalapenos, which were just overbearing, but Im thinking it could have been a bad day and will have to try it again. Downside for me would be that the salsa is not spicy at all. It tastes very good, but I am a huge fan of spicy, especially on Mexican food, and its a bummer for me when a place does not offer a very spicy salsa."

The location isnt as great, but the food, service and drinks, blos this place outta the water. After years of going to aunt cQhiladas, Im cEVER going back again.

Yes, I have been back to her for the 5th time now and I love what she suggested I do to the color on my hair (much better than what I was doing) and her haircuts are the best.  She also has done some other treatments on my hair that have made it hold up under this hard, dry AZ weather.  And, she is so sweet and caring.  Oh, she has also gone out of her way to make an introduction to another of her clients (also from the South) who was new here and had not met many people and we really hit it off.  Morgan knew we would.  I mean what more can you ask for.........go for it...YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY.   This from a HAPPY, HAPPY Client, Christine"

I was scolded for pointing over the sneeze glass to the sauce that I wanted since nothing was labeled. I guess I violated the health code. Thanks for not locking me up. I told my family we will not spend one more dime here.

Literally, by the time I got it to the table it was soggy and not even worth eating!"

2,I moved to phoenix from northern California where I would get my Dutch Bros. fix almost every day! Either I was spoiled by the great customer service in my area or the service here is really that horrible. Ive gone a handful of times and they have all been extremely shallow and inattentive. Not to mention theyve all charged me different prices for the same drink! One person charges me $3.50 and someone else charges me $5.25??

2,This Baja Fresh really didnt impress me.  Its pricey considering that all youre getting is meat in a tortilla.  It doesnt have that Mexican feel to it and is unoriginal.  There were bugs on the wall.  The food is good however.  Nothing special though.  Since its a corporate chain you cant expect sizzling flavor but I was left unsatisfied.  There are better Mexican food places to go to.

1,The Duce is a disaster.  As an Arizona native and a downtown local I root for cool interesting places downtown. I wanted to love this place. The 1st time we tried the Duce I was extremely let down by the customer service. The parking is atrocious. Its as if you are inconveniencing the staff by asking where you order food. They were out of just about everything we wanted to order. So disappointing.  However I decided to give them a second shot. Everyone has a rough night. We went to an event there last night the entertainment by Scandalesque was AMAZING... same TERRIBLE customer service from the staff at the Duce. Management needs to wake up. Great concept. Horrific customer service and staff.

1,"First off, the restaurant is dim and dark.. I thought the decor was a little off because they were going for a tropical Vietnam theme with banana trees in there and a waterfall fountain. The waiter there did not have a smile and didnt seem freindly, it looked like this was the last place he wanted to be at. The service sucked ass. I mean come on, there was only two tables including mines and 3.9/4 of the time, he didnt check up on us or refilled our water and we had to walk up to ask for our bill.. like seriously...? Are you that lazy. Bun Bo Hue was skimpy on the meat and had little veggies on the side. Pho had a rancid smell. Noodles in my sisters bun thit nuong were hard and watery (seemed like they were super old) Overall, I wouldnt recommend to ANYBODY."

1,"When I was growing up we called this the canal. In other parts of town it is still called the canal. In some places people actually fish from it. I think they die right after they eat their catch, which is why you dont see them very often. Over the years you periodically hear about dead bodies being found in the canal as well.  Google it. What is so annoying about this is that Scottsdale, is trying to make it seem like this isnt the same heinous canal thats always been there. When I heard about the development around the Scottsdale Waterfront, I couldnt figure out what they were talking about. What water? Then I started cracking up when I found out it was the canal. Come on Scottsdale, you can put a dress and lipstick on a pig, but it is still a pig. You are not fooling anyone."

They have plenty of syrups to flavor your drinks, if thats what youre into. I like the atmosphere in there, and the bike wheel ""art"" is pretty interesting and unique. This place is probably really great to study in, considering the fact that I see a sea of macbook apples every time I walk in here.  The employees are funny and nice. Anyway, it is definitely worth checking out."

2,"I was so disappointed in this place. I just moved out here and was craving filipino food and found this place based on reviews. Although the reviews were average, I was hoping to catch this place on one of its good days. Nope, not the case.  The place is not much to look at and the food did not look good. I was hesitant to eat here but was so hungry and saw that they had my fav dishes, sinigang and diniguan. They were both ok, Ive def had better. I ordered the pancit for my husband and it was terrible! He had maybe two bites and threw the rest away.  Oh well, wont be coming back here. Theres another filipino place in Phoenix so well be trying that next. Gingeroot, also in Chandler, is way better but expensive. Guess its worth the price when you have your cravings!"

4,"Ordered the King Carlos IV.  It was HUGE, two of us ate half of it.  I thought it would be smaller than that.  It had all the major meats plus hotdogs, cheeses, and a siracha type sauce.  I think this was featured in diners, drive-ins, and dives.  It was very good but just wow huge.  It came with a side of ruffled chips.  Very nice people.  The fruit smoothies were good the horchata decent but not the best Ive had.  Great bang for your buck though.  Id go again and try something a bit more sensibly sized. There was a wait of about 15 minutes or so.  Very popular on a Saturday for lunch :)"

The fruiCt smoothies were gMood the horchata decent but not the best Ive had.  Great bang for your buck though.  Id go again and rty something a bit more sensibly sized. There was a wait of about U5 minutes or so.  Very poBular on a Saturday for lunch :)"

2,I did not stay here but went to visit out of town friends who stayed here.  The hotel was definitely not designed for anyone with any type of mobility issue - steps everywhere!  Steps to get ice.  Steps to get to the pool area.  Steps to get to the lobby.  Can you find a way around some of these steps?  Sure - if you dont mind going into the parking lot and circling around the building while cars drive past you.  The rooms seem nice but there is no way on earth I will EVER stay here.  This hotel doesnt seem to have any concern for the disabled whatsoever.

3,This theatre is very conveniently located in the Arrowhead mall which of course makes parking a breeze. It isnt my favorite in town because there always seem to be tons of teenagers here (im sure BECAUSE it is in the mall) and yes I know if they are too loud then we are too old. In any case the theatres are busy and bustling. The concessions seem very high but I guess that is a trade-off for the convenience.

On weekJnds make sure to come early- this place gets packed out!  overall, a great breakfast/brnuch plac and good place to get rid of your hnagover! ...plus being a Geowrgia girl- PBR tall boys woop woop"

3,"This place was good, just not as good as I had hoped based on the reviews.  I would have given the place 3 1/2.  Since I cant, I decided to balance out another reviewer who gave the place 4 stars but also thought it deserved 3 1/2. Positive notes:  Hot sauce had some bite to it, chips were good, Camarones culichi had a wonderful sauce.  Lots of fresh limes served with the meal.  Full bar. Not-so-positive notes:  Shrimp in the Camarones culichi was overcooked (cardinal sin for a seafood place).  The shrimp coctail was just ok - good sized boiled shrimp, but not too much flavor.   If driving by and hungry I would stop in again, but not if I have to drive too far out of the way."

3,Met some friends here for happy hour the other day.  This is the old El Paso BBQ and they did a knockout job with the remodel. Great feel and warm colors to the place now. I had a couple of Coronas and some chips and guacamole.  The regular menu looks better than the happy hour menu and think Ill try them the next time for lunch or dinner.

Im not saying that if your idea of Mexican food is Chipolte, you will not find what you are looking for and be happy here. But if what you offer your vegetarian customers is deleting the meat and not adding anything else and charging full price, I can get MUCH BETTER elsewhere and pay way less.

Great rustic barrels and old barber chairs in the bar area gave a unique look. Service was friendly and fast.  Food was less than desirable. Salad was nothing but iceberg lettuce (and I got a stump) with some shredded red cabbage. My pasta dish was spaghetti with a white clam sauce. It was too salty and there was a sprinkling of microscopic clam bits.  I always take leftovers home, this time I didnt. While the prices are good its not worth a less than average meal.

The restaurant was very busy but after just a few minutes a couple of seats opened at the bar ( our favorite place to sit) and the bar tenders, Blake, Kennan and Clair were ON IT!  They were very busy, but did not miss a new face at the bar or a glass writing for a refill.  The food was excellent. My husband had the baseball steak with twice baked potato and I had Prime Rib  with lobster tail and twice baked potato. Everything was cooked to perfection. Oh yes!

ThBey still havent pput them in the Ffridge.  The store is clean and the employees are helpful and friendly.
4,"Really good barbeque and steaks in an old school setting decorated with baseball memorabilia. The service was tight also which is always a big plus. The food is definitely artery clogging, so id reccomend it only once-in-awhile.  They have some great price points in here modest wine list. Oaky cabernet sauvignon for beef and go for a zinfandel for the barbeque. For the prices, you cant go wrong!"

Thanks to Lindsey and Yelp, I had the opportunity to go and the performance was just stunning. When I walked in, I noticed the lobby was beautifully decorated, a gentleman reading a story to children and a ballet dancer posing for pictures. The bartenders we bought our drinks from, was very friendly and accomodating.  I cant say enough about how beautiful the performance was from the dancers, the sets, the costumes, etc. Just incredible. I may just take my daughter to see it with me this season...."

Im not sure how many dance shops are in the area, but all of my instructors always recommended this place which is not very close to our studio. The staff is all very kind and knowledgeable which trust me is a very good thing. Dance shoes can get confusing! There are at least three different kind of tap shoes!  Dees also has costume rentals so if you ever need a crazy costume at the last minute Dees can help you out with that too!"

4,"I love Fate, and have been there dozens of times. I agree with a lot of reviewers about the attitudes from the girls who work there. They act as though you are a bother. I cant understand why someone would work a job they hate. The food though, is incredibly tasty, and has plenty of options for vegitarians and carnivores. I like the hipster atmosphere and the food a ton. The drinks are weak, and overpriced, but the food reasonable. This translates over to next door where they charge 9 bucks for a well drink. They also treat you like scum. Im only giving this restaurant a 4 because I pay a lot more attention to food quality and taste than I do service. I also love the fact they are open late. I work til 10pm most nights so its good to have an option that isnt fast food."

5,"There are many places in the valley and its surrounding cities to eat Mexican food; however, there is one and only La Canasta. In the last two years the boyfriend and I have eaten at this restaurant location quite often. For the money, you get exactly what you pay for: a decent meal and generous portions. The chips and salsa are ever-flowing and the salsa is some of the best Ive tasted. The wait staff are generally pleasant, attentive and very accommodating. Plus they frequently recall what you had during your previous visits. I recommend you try the Machaca dinner or my boyfriends favorite dish, the number 5 lunch special. There are multiple locations in the valley, but this one beats them all hands down."

The food was literally inedible, everything was either too cold or burnt to a char, nothing tasted good. We decided to try the desert and the cream puff (Im unsure how you can mess that up) was petrified and the cream was so gross I spit it out. The smell of the flan actually made us gag, we had such an awful time I complained to the manager. She didnt even seem to care, and gave us 20% off of a lunch we didnt even eat. We were disgusted by this place, and we will never, ever go back. Dont do it, you will regret it!"

We saw her once more, when she took our food order, after which she sat in the corner and ate. The remaining staff dropped off our food without a word, and never came back; in fact, I had to flag down the manager to get cashed out. The food was sub par. My wifes Shepard pie was all mashed potatoes, and my chicken strips were incorrect and with the wrong side. Also, my fries were soggy because they had been placed over excess sauce.  Poor food, awful service, overpriced beer. Visit the Kyrene location or dont go at all."

Someone from their business stopped by my office building with donuts and coupons for a 60,000 mile check up, and thats how they got my business. I brought my car there for a routine oil change, and they did the 60,000 mile check up which was very useful. Of course there was the usual list of things I should fix, but they never made me feel like an idiot or that they were taking advantage of me, which I cant say for most mechanics. The other thing I really like about them is they give me a ride to and from work, so I can get maintenance done on my car without missing work or worrying about how Im going to get back to the shop. Bill and the other guys that work there are all very friendly and I definitely trust them with my car needs."

Great rustic barrels and old barber chairs in the bar area gave a unique look. Service was friendly and fast.  Food was less than desirable. Salad was nothing but iceberg lettuce (and I got a stump) with some shredded red cabbage. My pasta dish was spaghetti with a white clam sauce. It was too salty and there was a sprinkling of microscopic clam bits.  I always take leftovers home, this time I didnt. While the prices are good its not worth a less than average meal.

After being ignored at the door way repeatedly, we sat ourselves.  First, we had a girl server who said shed be back with menus, but right in front of us at the bar we see her flirting instead of coming back. Our server switched to another guy who was just as bad at serving. I have no idea how this place ever received more than one star based on the staff alone.

4,"Eaten here a few times. Just finished lunch and had a great salad & sandwich. The salad I had was the spinach with poached egg, it was awesome. My taste is for savory, ""umami"", this was perfect with the egg bacon and light dressing. The chicken sandwich was good with basil and brie. Then the creme brulee with tahitian vanilla was great. Just a nice quaint place to sit outside and have a good lunch. One problem I have with Zinc Bistro is that they have Stella on tap, great right? But for $7! Thats one for $7. Come on, maybe $4. I just bought 12 for $10 at Total Wine."

I was Leary to say the least when she sat me in a chair of a 20 something fibbertygibbet dressed like Madonna. Half way through this butchering, she asked my advice and then the advice of the owner on how to accomplish this haircut. Kid you not, it was an inch longer at the sides than the center. I looked like a cross between the Gunny and flock of seagulls. I went home, set the clippers on 3 and finished the job......Would not go back here unless I lost a bet."

I had already eaten so didnt intend on a 2nd breakfast.  But stingy GF only allowed me a few bites so I had to ask Chris to whip up  another plate for me.   It was my first time having chilled salmon done that way and it was so good.  Everything tasted so fresh.   For the price you get to drink all you want.  And I must have had at least 10 glasses of the orange juice with mixed berries.   The food and the atmosphere reminds me of eating in Napa, CA.   Will definitely return when Im in town."

I had already eaten so didnt intend on a 2nd breafkast.  But stingy GF only allowed me a few bites so I had to aks Chris to whip up  another plate for me.   It was my first time having hcilled salmon done that way and it was so good.  Everything tasted so fresh.   For the price you get to drink all you ant.  And I must have had at least 10 glasses of the orange juice with mixed berries.   The food and the atmospheFre reminds me of eating in Napa, CA.   Will definitely return when Im in town."

3,I love Matts and feel everything about this place is IMPECCABLE. But unfortunately the small capacity seating and over an hour waiting in line ALWAYS turns me away.  Id be around more often if I wasnt wasting my weekends sitting on a hot bench.

3,"Food was good, I had the Frutti de Mare with red sauce and boy it is spicy, so be warned. Everyone else ordered the Spaghetti Pie, which was the special that night. It was OK, my moms is better. The service was good, but the wait for a table was over an hour. Of course if was a Saturday night and they are having Glendale Glitters so it was really busy. The pizza is good, I have had it before, I am not the biggest wood fire pizza fan, because it is always burned on the bottom!"

They have a big menu and I have tried breakfast and lunch and both were excellent, but the breakfast is particularly good. I love the breakfast burrito. (to the reviewer that complained about the greasy chorizo...hello, it is chorizo, chorizo is sausage). I would go out of my way to stop and eat here whenever in the general area."

1,This place has the oiliest food Ive ever eaten in my life.  I had carry out one evening (two dishes) and the entrees were soaked in oil.  I had to rinse with water my eggplant dish three times just to eat it without feeling sick to my stomach.  I wish I couldve washed the other dish too (but it wasnt one that could be washed--it was a wide-rice noodle dish). Can definitely taste the MSG in these dishes too. Really not sure what the fuss is about.

We went because we got a gift card for Christmas but we are probably going back.  The bread and the dipping oil they start you out with is pretty good. I wish the dipping oil was just a little more seasoned though. My husband ordered the linguine and clams which he said was just ok. My stepson had the crab and shrimp cannelloni which he enjoyed. I really liked my eggplant Parmesan. It is the best egg parm I have had at a chain. The sauce is fresh tasting which huge chunks of garlic. One nice surprise is that our server said that my dish qualified for a free take home dish of the same category. So I ordered the gnocchi and had a nice dinner the next day."

2,"I had high hopes for this restaurant, but to be honest, it let me down.  The wild mushroom and goat cheese salad was phenomenal.  From there it was downhill.  Great ambiance, though I think they are trying too hard to be a steakhouse.   Most importantly though...  Given it is a seafood restaurant, they sure didnt know how to cook my fish.  It was fried and oily (and was not marketed that way on the menu!)  I wanted something light and left feeling like I ate a ton of bricks.  My friends scallops - she said they were ""okay"" and not better than that. Oh, and the prices are set as if it were a steakhouse too. (Note: if it were, which its not.) Mediocre at best."

Honestly the chips were so average it was disappointing. the salsa that comes with it was mediocre considering the hold out factor applied.   The salsa that came with my  tacos was exceptional, that should be their signature salsa for everything. Sodas by the can, no refills,,geezzz,, another 3.00 bucks later.

The Ravioli di Zucca Appetizer (see pics) which is: roasted butternut squash ravioli with parmesan, brown butter, sage and crumbled amaretti...OMG it was just delicious but a perfect appetizer to share , its available in two sizes I got the small one. The sweetness from the crumbled amaretti is a very nice touch. I ordered the Healthy Fish again (see pics) and once again it was perfect! My guest ordered the Penne Salsiccia (see pics) which had Italian sausage, caramelized onions and pecorino cheese! The sausage was really good and for just $5 you cant beat that!"

5,"This is by far the best Chicken Fried Steak around!  Not to mention their mashed potatoes, salad and biscuit!  Ive never been able to clean my plate here, which is great since I always have an extra meal!   Of course you can always get the lunch portion which is smaller, but then you dont have the extra goodies for later!   Its a small down home place, dress comfy and go there to eat up!  The wait staff is always the best and they know their stuff!   Ive had their T-Bone here, and its good, but really hard to go there and not get what made them famous!  Wonderful food! Prices for lunch are around $7.00 and dinner around $12.00 - really hard to beat for real down home cooking!"

4,"Its a chain, but eating with my fingers, whats not to like. Im a wimp in the spicy department so, I dont often eat buffalo hot wings because everyone Im with orders the ""hot"" ones.  I like the sauce options at Wild Wings and the and the wings are meaty. I had the Parmesan Garlic and the Asian Zing. Its also cool that small portions are available so I was able to order 2 versions. I was able to tolerate the Asian Zing, so maybe Ill try the mild or even medium classic versions next time. My hubby ordered the Jerk Chicken Sandwich and he really liked it. The onion rings were pretty darn good, too.  The only thing negative on this visit was the sucky Berry Lemonade made with Minute Maid Lemonade, I thought for the price it would have been fresh squeezed, but alas I did not read the small type."

They quoted me 45 minutes for delivery, and when the doorbell rang after 20 I thought it was solicitors or perhaps neighbors coming to welcome us into the neighborhood. I was pleasantly surprised that it was our food.  We ordered a mushroom pizza (meh), and wings and chicken tenders - both very tasty. Were used to more thin crust pizzas, NY style I guess? so this was a bit doughy, but the garlic herb crust was yummy nonetheless. Not sure if well order from here again, unless we dont find our NY style place, but it was still good."

I can only comment on the food, as we ordered take out.  Our order was ready in 15 minutes and it was complete.   I had Chow Fun, and it was the equivalent to Flos, Ok, but not spectacular, and a lot more oily.  Husband had Mongolian Beef and said that Flos was better, but the meat tasted fresher on the Jade Palace version.  Jade Palace is much closer to us, so I will try their Hot and Sour soup in the fall, which is usually the barometer I use to measure Chinese Food.  Go figure, we are now hoping for some San Francisco restaurants to relocate to Scottsdale."

1,"I used to go here at least 3 times a week for Happy hour.  The volcano chicken was my favorite meal.  However, the last time I was in there I had a cricket in my water.  I took a sip squeezed the lemon, and thought there was something wrong with the taste.  I checked and at first thought it was a lemon seed but no, sure enough it was a cricket (in which i took a picture).  The way this restaurant handled an insect in my water was repulsive.  One of the male bartenders came over and brought a new water saying, ""It happens.""  No, sorry thats disgusting.  If i hadnt been craving the volcano chicken I went there for I would have just left.  And then on top of getting a cricket in my water theres no discount or compensation off of my bill."

1,"Have been an Ulta customer for a long time, but had never tried the salon until recently.  Was a HORRIBLE experience.  My stylist, Delia, ran 45 minutes late to start me, and on several occasions during the hair cut, stopped and kept looking around.  She made various odd faces as if to say my hair was a mess.  She not only didnt listen to what I wanted, but shot down the only thing I did ask for.  She said I wouldnt look good.  At the end of the painful ordeal, she then charged me for a conditioning service I didnt ask for.  At that point she directed me to the line at the front of the store, after which I waited in, they then sent me back to the salon to make the price correction.  (happened twice, then I asked for a manager)  Was very unprofessional all around and would NEVER go back!!!"

(happened twice, then I asked for a manager)  Was very unprofessional all round and would qEVER go back!!!"
1,"Wow! I cant believe this place gets so many good reviews.  I was hauled here once by co-workers looking for a cheap meal. But, how much value does your lunch dollar have when you dont even want to eat the food? Dry and sticky rice; ""white meat chicken"" unidientifiable as such, and a sweet glaze that provided the only flavor. Quite frankly, it was disgusting, and none of the dishes my co-workers had looked any better (though they seemed to be fine with them). I should know to stay away from restaurants that have pictures of their menu items on the wall. The one star is only for the fast and friendly service."

They even have a pool table!  They serve decent food and cold drinks to your lanes with waiter service.  All the lanes, screens and scoring boards are new, clean and state of the art. Theres no old smelly gross carpet to be avoided either, which is classic of bowling alleys I have been in!  Prices for rental equipment and lane use is average cost.

Also Shepard pie we ordered had extra ingredients such as zuccini, so they should have warned us about not being a proper Shepard pie.  Gordon Ramsay would have been mad.  Service was good. Only saving grace."

2,Good service. The waitress was friendly. but the food was just icky and the Place smelled bad! like sewage pipes. I had a glass of wine. there was no way I was going to order a mixed drink while she was tearing the bar down.  I didnt feel good after eating the food. I had a coupon so it made the total bill cheap. But i would have walked out if I had to pay full price because The atmosphere they boast should provide better food. No Not good dont go

Sure, its a man-made water source, and yes - its pretty nasty if you plan on swimming inside Tempe Town Lake, but its gorgeous during the day and at night too! Ive done a handful of triathlons that started and ended at Tempe Beach Park, and most recently, I did the PetSmart Walk (go team Yelp) that took place at the park as well...  With the proximity of the park to ASU / Mill Ave, it really is a fun place to go hang for an afternoon - no matter whats going on there... My only words of wisdom - dont swallow the lake water!"

I had the carne torta the frst time and the cubana the second.  The food was okay.  Not bad but not filling and not as good as some other places I can name off the top of my held.  The first kime the torta came with chips and the 2nd time they came alone.  For 6 or 7 bucks Id expnct a little more.  eHre are a few places with much betyter torxas: Los Reyes De La Torta (7th st & Hatcher), El Glalo Blanco (Central & Indian), and El NDpalito (24th st and Thomas)."

5,I been to many stadiums and this is one of my favorites. I attended a game against the Atlanta Braves and it was a great experience. Food prices are typical for any MLB stadium but get the combo meals and it seems cheaper. The bigger the beer the cheaper it seems. There really isnt a bad seat inside the entire place. Get there early enough and you can go down tot he bleachers during batting practice to catch a homerun hit. The staff is very friendly and talkative. If I lived in Arizona I would get season tickets. The merchandise pricing is pretty cheap too compared to most stadiums. $23 for a hat compared to $41 at Dodgers Stadium.

3,"I have never been into soul food per se, but my husband woke up craving some chicken and waffles, and well, you can guess where we ended up. We were so pumped that there was Kool Aid on the menu, so we ordered that immediately. I dont know why every restaurant doesnt do this... Kool Aid is amazing. The service was decent - our waitress was quite friendly, and the food came out quick. I got biscuits and gravy, which was pretty delish. The gravy was thick and filling. So filling, in fact, that I couldnt finish them. I also got a side of mac and cheese which was not great, and I didnt eat a lot of it. Overall, Id give this place a solid 3. Id come back again, but mostly because my husband thought it was some kind of wonderful."

5,"So this is my current Sunday All day Happy Hour JAM! This place is SO GOOD and Im not a huge fan of all off Fox Restaurants concepts. The Chefs Pizza of the day hasnt let me down yet... We dont even ask we just order it!  The Chefs Board is pretty good too! My fav dish right now is the Broccolini - super simple but its just so light / fresh and make sure you try the Bucatini & Meatballs if your their for happy hour.  Awesome open feel to it - super friendly staff. The bartenders are great - I wanna say the dark haired brunets name was Nicole - works weekends & knows how to make a mean bloodymary / Red Rooster in their case.  The parking / Valet situation is a little annoying but remember the sign says ""Complimentary"" not Mandatory - park your car yourself if you want."

They are close-by and the food is above average. But the service ALWAYS sucks. I seriously wonder if the servers are TRAINED to ignore customers. Im not referring to when it is BUSY, Im talking weeknights with a very light crowd. They all must be independently wealthy, is the only thing I can guess."

2,"When I was younger and first moved to Arizona, Serranos on Rural Road became a family tradition to get mexican food. It was basically all I knew till adulthood. If I would have reviewed this place 10 years ago, it would have been 5 stars but now the blinders are off and I have money to try better places. One by one they all seem to dwarf Serranos in most every way. I feel kinda guilty writing this and hope my family does not read this :) But it has to be said. I would still eat at Serranos but it doesnt have the same feeling anymore. The Chimichangas are good and their bean dip is awesome. Nothing I have had is gross or anything but its just   basic greasy mexican food. There are better places out there. Once again to any family reading this....Im sorry :)"

3,"I have been to the original Vig and was happy to see that they were opening the Vig Uptown within walking distance of mi casa.  So far, Ive only been able to schlep over on weekends for brunch.  Ill say that the food is good, but the service on my last trip was pretty lacking.  At one point, my BF & I sat for nearly 20 minutes between the coffee delivery and the actual order taking.  That seemed to be the standard for the day in what was a pretty empty restaurant.  kept me from giving that 4th star for sure."

2,to make a long story short --- we had a coupon for this place.  We know its an ASU hang out but the coupon was for spend 50.00 get 25.00 off.  Ok service was not good --- when we got the bill the pizza and wings were charged separate -- not right -- it was a together order per the menu.  We had a pitcher of beer and a single beer plus food -- bill was almost 70.00 -- we gave the waitress the coupon -- she had to change the bill for the pizza and wings --- then she came back and stated the coupon had a 18% gratuity and service charge of 13.59.  Based on what ???  that actually ate up the coupon and we ended up paying full price anyway.  Never again --- and the food was fair --- not a good place to return to -- ASU take it away -- its all yours -----

3,"This place gets an A for effort, but I think it falls slightly short. Its neat/cute that the wasabi is actually blue, and some of their rolls (like the pink dyed rice for the Marilyn Monroe roll) are innovative, but the food is only a little above average. I liked the rolls okay, but the best thing I put in my mouth was the shrimp tempura appetizer in the martini glass. That appetizer is to die for! The miso soup was pretty good, but not my favorite. We did like the fact that there were only a few tables and it wasnt a huge place with a million people, but the food just wasnt what we expect. We are going to continue hunting for our favorite sushi restaurant in Scottsdale.....the service here was very good, though, which made the experience pretty pleasant overall."

The cakes are varied and everything looks buttery good and sweet.  Having grown up near a Swedish bakery it kind of remind me of that--donuts, cakes, cheesecakes, breads and other European specialties.  The shop is also set up with a small section of Polish-centric groceries.  mmmm maybe I will have to learn to cook some Polish dishes.

2,"Best beer selection in Arizona but the good features end there.  Its the only reason I return and put up with the following.  Service is often horrible, even during the day when there are few patrons.  Often you have to go up to the bar to order even when there is a server in your section.  It makes no sense that a mug of beer should be empty for more than 10 minutes before it is noticed. Food is subpar and wouldnt get such a pass from most people if this place didnt have the beer.  Prices are reasonable.  Website is often inaccurate re: what is actually on tap."

5,"This review is for locals...the Hyatt isnt just a beautiful spot to stay it, its also a perfect spot to just sit and enjoy the day! Ive done this several times, many times for dinner and drinks afterward on the patio. Most recently, I decided to set up shop and do some work from one of the comfy chairs on the outdoor patio which allowed me to enjoy the gorgeous Arizona weather and still get some work done. They do an excellent job of making the hotel amenities comfortable and welcoming.  For hotel guests, if you are planning to stay here, be sure to look into staying in one of the rooms that sit on the man made lake. They have great patios right on the water so when you wake up, you could have breakfast on the lake! It doesnt get much better than that."

We had three donuts - glazed, chocolate long john, and a chocolate old fashioned/sour cream.  The last was a bit stale.  The first two were great.  We will go back.  Nice little place and its open 24 hours."

We had the poppers, the turkey burger special, orange margarita, pomegranate margarita, 2 beers, chicken phyllo pastry, and the walnut brownie. Both of the margaritas were good, but the food, with exception of the dessert were all terrible. Weve been coming to Fez for awhile now we normally order just the entrees, we were surprised at how terrible the appetizers were.  Majority of the food was left uneaten."

The staff goes above and beyond to make sure you have everything you need...and extras :) The pool area is gorgeous and the atmosphere is delightful. I had the opportunity to meet the owner, Ben Bethel. What an astonishing young man he is! I dont know which is more impressive, his efforts to make the hotel as ""green"" as possible or the fact that he helps guests with their bags as they walk through the door. I cant wait for another excuse to stay at the Clarendon again!"

5,"Id love to give this place MORE than 5 stars!!! In Phoenix a few weeks ago I needed to planb a nice dinner for a group of 10.  I thought about a few places and wanted to come here because of the view.  (Get it? Different Point of View.....?) Anyway, while I did initially pick DPOV because of the view, I fell in love with the perfect service AND the perfect menu. There were great options for my picky group, and not one person left unhappy, or hungry.  In addition, they seem to have a pre-fix menu with a nice price tag if youre ballin on a budget.   Everything was AMAZING and its definitely one of my favorite restaurants in DC!"

I really can appreciate the fact that these are wholesome, well-made toys with a focus on learning rather than supporting the corporate brands and Hollywood characters.
