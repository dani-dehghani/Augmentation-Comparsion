3,"I finally tried Spicy Pickle last week. I like the name and was intrigued about their menu. Paninis, soups, salads, pizzetas, nothing out of the ordinary. I had a half sandwich ( Sausalito Bandido?), half salad combo ( Spinach salad). Food was fresh and good. The sandwich could have stand a little more meat, it was truly flat. The salad was crisp and dressing was on the side, which I appreciated.   On my way out I got a chocolate chip cookie that was OK. I love cookies and they have to be pretty bad for me not to like them. This one, I kid you not, must have had maybe 3-4 chocolate chips? So if youre craving chocolate, this is not the cookie for you."

2,"Whats up with the premium gas in this state being only 91 grade?  Wheres the 93?  Anyhoo, this is a very busy gas station at the corner of 16th and Highland. When the pumps are full of cars, its hard to maneuver in and around the parking lot. The store looks a bit short on supplies, but then again I just went inside to pay.  I may give it another try, well see.  But Ill look elsewhere first."

4,"Ok reviewing the Waffle House is kinda lame, but here goes.  If you have lived in America at any point in the last 50 years you know they have good waffles and hash browns.  Is it the best breakfast option you could possibly encounter, well no.  Its just every once in awhile I find I just want Waffle House. ( Fond late night memories from college I would guess. )  It can be for breakfast, lunch, dinner, whenever. So what does this location have going for it that makes it better than the average Waffle House? 1. Lots of parking 2. Its not in a shady part of town 3. It has a really nice staff  4. They are fairly speedy 5. The restaurant is clean So there you go if you have a craving for waffles and hash browns then this is one of the better WH in the area."

3,"Typical Taco Bell with typical Taco Bell menu (other than the Popeyes Fish they serve from the same kitchen/counter). Not sure if some of the people in the kitchen could speak English. One employee on break sat in front of a small TV in the seating area which was VERY LOUD and ANNOYING. Every table was dirty despite it not being very busy, and the bottles of condiments at the ""fixins"" bar were filthy. Cant beat the prices, though. As usual, I left ""stuft"" on two bucks."

2,"Ive always said if the guacamole, chips and salsa arent good, the food is not likely to be good either.  I was right, Guacamole was not very good at all, same with the salsa.  Rest of the food was just okay but for a restaurant in the Biltmore I expected so much better.  Just as a note, when it comes to Mexican food, Im super critical.  This place will probably get a higher ratings from people of the Midwest."

1,"Wednesday 7pm.  This place is your average over priced, lack of taste chain food restaurant and this place was no different.  I have to say, I was super disappointed as I have always heard rave reviews, now Im starting to question who I associate with and their taste in food. Service=slow. Food=just tastes like salt Noise=loud and they do a dance...like a lot. Go somewhere else and skip Joes Crabs."

1,"Have been an Ulta customer for a long time, but had never tried the salon until recently.  Was a HORRIBLE experience.  My stylist, Delia, ran 45 minutes late to start me, and on several occasions during the hair cut, stopped and kept looking around.  She made various odd faces as if to say my hair was a mess.  She not only didnt listen to what I wanted, but shot down the only thing I did ask for.  She said I wouldnt look good.  At the end of the painful ordeal, she then charged me for a conditioning service I didnt ask for.  At that point she directed me to the line at the front of the store, after which I waited in, they then sent me back to the salon to make the price correction.  (happened twice, then I asked for a manager)  Was very unprofessional all around and would NEVER go back!!!"

2,"I got the banana nutella cupcake and love the banana bread-like cupcake. However, the frosting is way too sweet and overpowers the banana flavor of the cupcake. As many reviewers have already mentioned, the cupcake is also over-priced at $3.75 each for the size and the lack of creativity.  With so many desert/snack places in Scottsdale, I am unlikely to come back here."

Service was prompt and polite.  The food?  Eh.  I had one of the house specials.  I didnt think it was very special.  I do think the waiter deserves bonus points for talking me into a half order rather than a full order.  The lemon-lime beverage was strong and sweet."

The food is gross, the tortillas are ok, I like the decor actually, but the employees are slutty (and by slutty I saw skirts soo short if they picked something off the floor you for sure would see vagina) Apparently the uniform is jean skirts and heels. This is the male glittery shirt wearing capitol of Scottsdale. The food sucks, dont eat here!"

5,"Tempe Beach Park - such a gem in our landlocked State... Sure, its a man-made water source, and yes - its pretty nasty if you plan on swimming inside Tempe Town Lake, but its gorgeous during the day and at night too! Ive done a handful of triathlons that started and ended at Tempe Beach Park, and most recently, I did the PetSmart Walk (go team Yelp) that took place at the park as well...  With the proximity of the park to ASU / Mill Ave, it really is a fun place to go hang for an afternoon - no matter whats going on there... My only words of wisdom - dont swallow the lake water!"

3,Stopped in and tried both their sweet potato fries and zucchini fries. Much fonder of the sweet potatoes & the others were a little heavy?!   Like previous posts I was not to fond of their dipping sauces either. Loved their freshly prepared lemonade and the great outside spot to people watch!

2,This place has not gotten any better over the past 10 years. The service is still bad and they are always running out of food and the food isnt that great either.  Will have to say that I will not be going back to this location or the one off of Glendale and 19th ave.

4,"I had expected this place to be a rather small museum, but it is actually quite large and is packed with artifacts and pieces from Native American tribes.  During our visit, we took a tour given by a Navajo student.  He was very knowledgeable and definitely kept everyones attention with the information that he provided.  With the amount of exhibits on display in this museum, you can easily spend two or three hours just taking in everything that is offered.  There is a wide range of items on display from dolls to paintings to glass work to clothing and jewelry.  Another cool thing is that this museum allows you to photograph anything that you want."

2,"The food is good here, ordered the Mole enchiladas with no complaints, however we also ordered a skinny margarita which was not very strong and $15 ea! The regular margaritas are fine and priced okay at $8, but to charge $15 without warning is usury. The service was okay, not great. The menu is also hard to read because the type and busy background design. I would have given 4 stars if the margaritas were $11, but $15?? This is not Modern Steak or the W !!"

Yes, I am a tourist and yes, I am from a part of the US where cowboys are not common, so walking into a place full of country western paraphanalia made me smile.  The service was good, the food was delicious, and I walked out with a few good photos.  The coffee was a tad bit weak, but Im a starbucks bold drinker, so I dont hold it against them."

2,"Uhhh...These are supposed to be carne fries?  ASU boys think that these are the best carne fries. Me thinks not. The carne fries consist of boiled meat AND the order is wrong. Its supposed to have the guacamole on top of the sour cream on top of the melted cheese over the meat, but they just dumped the boiled carne asada on top of the sour cream. I told some ASU boy about this, but he said that I probably had a different person making my carne fries  the wrong way. What a disappointment, but I ate everything anyway because Im fat like that. hahha"

One Kids Burger with Apple Slices (Nope) one side of hummus(Nope) But they are quick to charge you for the order. Then you call and talk to a girl name Liz and she begins to tell you that they are correct and you the customer are wrong. Even though I have all the food sitting in front of me nope still no kids burger or side of hummus. HMMMMM,.. keep letting her answer the phone and you will see your to go customer base decline. We are an office in Scottsdale that everyday is ordering lunch for the office, Daphnes has officially been removed from the menu book. Nice customer service!!!!!!"

Sawed right off in broad daylight.  According to the cops, car break ins and catalytic converter thefts happen frequently here.  BEWARE!  The water park management doesnt give a shit.  Even the cop laughs because they always say the same thing:  ""Our camera is broken but its getting fixed next week"".  What a joke.  If you go, have someone drop you off.  Youve been warned!"

I think they die right after they eat their catch, which is why you dont see them very often. Over the years you periodically hear about dead bodies being found in the canal as well.  Google it. What is so annoying about this is that Scottsdale, is trying to make it seem like this isnt the same heinous canal thats always been there. When I heard about the development around the Scottsdale Waterfront, I couldnt figure out what they were talking about. What water? Then I started cracking up when I found out it was the canal. Come on Scottsdale, you can put a dress and lipstick on a pig, but it is still a pig. You are not fooling anyone."

Also Shepard pie we ordered had extra ingredients such as zuccini, so they should have warned us about not being a proper Shepard pie.  Gordon Ramsay would have been mad.  Service was good. Only saving grace."

3,This theatre is very conveniently located in the Arrowhead mall which of course makes parking a breeze. It isnt my favorite in town because there always seem to be tons of teenagers here (im sure BECAUSE it is in the mall) and yes I know if they are too loud then we are too old. In any case the theatres are busy and bustling. The concessions seem very high but I guess that is a trade-off for the convenience.

1,"Remember how I said that the Trivia was the best thing about this place?  Well, they got rid of long time Triva host, Dave (who had been featured in the College Times and was the best thing about the trivia).  Without Daves personality, this place just doesnt cut it.  Will never go here again. Bummer."

1,"I used to go here at least 3 times a week for Happy hour.  The volcano chicken was my favorite meal.  However, the last time I was in there I had a cricket in my water.  I took a sip squeezed the lemon, and thought there was something wrong with the taste.  I checked and at first thought it was a lemon seed but no, sure enough it was a cricket (in which i took a picture).  The way this restaurant handled an insect in my water was repulsive.  One of the male bartenders came over and brought a new water saying, ""It happens.""  No, sorry thats disgusting.  If i hadnt been craving the volcano chicken I went there for I would have just left.  And then on top of getting a cricket in my water theres no discount or compensation off of my bill."

1,"We ordered $40 worth of pizza for takeout and it took almost 2 hours -- was told 20 minutes. We were not compd for anything. When I expressed my dissatisfaction, they offered to give me $40 credit toward my next order. I asked for this in writing, and they gave me the ""we cant provide it in writing -- we wrote your name down and have you on record"" line. Guess what -- I called back a couple months later and they had no record. They refused to honor the credit....and were rude. I asked to speak to the owner, and was told ""hes out of town."" The pizza is mediocre at best. I have zero tolerance for businesses such as this. PLEASE spend your money somewhere else that deserves to be patronized."

Microwaved enchiladas, no rice, rude, cold, unfriendly, uninviting service...If youre looking for a fabulous, neighborhood mexican restaurant, try Las Glorias Grill. The location isnt as great, but the food, service and drinks, blows this place outta the water. After years of going to aunt chiladas, Im NEVER going back again. They dont deserve your money either...."

5,"This review is for locals...the Hyatt isnt just a beautiful spot to stay it, its also a perfect spot to just sit and enjoy the day! Ive done this several times, many times for dinner and drinks afterward on the patio. Most recently, I decided to set up shop and do some work from one of the comfy chairs on the outdoor patio which allowed me to enjoy the gorgeous Arizona weather and still get some work done. They do an excellent job of making the hotel amenities comfortable and welcoming.  For hotel guests, if you are planning to stay here, be sure to look into staying in one of the rooms that sit on the man made lake. They have great patios right on the water so when you wake up, you could have breakfast on the lake! It doesnt get much better than that."

2,"When I was younger and first moved to Arizona, Serranos on Rural Road became a family tradition to get mexican food. It was basically all I knew till adulthood. If I would have reviewed this place 10 years ago, it would have been 5 stars but now the blinders are off and I have money to try better places. One by one they all seem to dwarf Serranos in most every way. I feel kinda guilty writing this and hope my family does not read this :) But it has to be said. I would still eat at Serranos but it doesnt have the same feeling anymore. The Chimichangas are good and their bean dip is awesome. Nothing I have had is gross or anything but its just   basic greasy mexican food. There are better places out there. Once again to any family reading this....Im sorry :)"

Beers are overpriced but absolutely necessary to make it through the event.  Those combo deals that include beers and a game card seem like a good idea, until its 45 minutes later, youre out of points, youre nowhere near drunk and youve already spent $40. If you go late, try not to get syphilis when you walk by San Felipes."

The current staff is incredibly immature and act like children yelling, and even barking, at high decibels.  Ive never seen anything like  it anywhere.  Ill have to think twice about coming back if this continues."

5,"This is by far the best Chicken Fried Steak around!  Not to mention their mashed potatoes, salad and biscuit!  Ive never been able to clean my plate here, which is great since I always have an extra meal!   Of course you can always get the lunch portion which is smaller, but then you dont have the extra goodies for later!   Its a small down home place, dress comfy and go there to eat up!  The wait staff is always the best and they know their stuff!   Ive had their T-Bone here, and its good, but really hard to go there and not get what made them famous!  Wonderful food! Prices for lunch are around $7.00 and dinner around $12.00 - really hard to beat for real down home cooking!"

He is friendly and chipper, but not so much so that hes annoying as your first human contact of the day. He is generous with the toppings and speedy."

5,"I really like this bar & restaurant.  I usually come here to meet up with a friend and sit at the main bar.  It is modern and clean.  There are a couple bars to sit at and they even open a big door to a bar for the outside too.  They have some good brews on tap and have flat screen tvs as well.   I have only had a burger and fries here.  They burger was really good, the fries were really greasy and were just okay. The staff here is friendly & speedy.  I would recommend this place for a good place for someone looking for a nice place to grab a drink and converse."

1,Was I there on a bad day or what?  I showed up 15 minutes after they opened and EVERY item I tried was either luke warm or cold.    They have 15+ items on the lunch buffet and I tried a bite of all of them.   Gross and bland.   I felt sick to my stomach after I left because I kept thinking how bad the food was. Yuck!

5,"I ADORE this place. Matts has been a staple breakfast, brunch, whatever place for me since I moved to Downtown 5 years ago. They just moved to a great place up the street (where Verde used to be for locals) with more room so now everything isnt so crammed! Not that we all didnt enjoy their original house, this one just says, ""Im still awesome, I just stepped up a notch."" Everything is delicious. I love their 5 Spot, the waffles are great, and their lunch specials are always amazing. If you like jelly - try their homemade stuff. Try the bacon."

5,"Ah what a beauty and wonder Camelback mountain is. However I do warn beginners to use the easier trail on the East side near Invergorden which runs north south and turns into 64th st. It is a bit of a walk from the parking through the neighborhood but the hike is less treacherous and much easier and takes you up a gradual slope to the top. Be very careful its easy to loose the trail on that side too.  Of course all the Phoenicians like to go to Echo Canyon at Mcdonald and 44th street bend. Parking can be bad at peak times on weekends--I definetely recommend late afternoon hiking, less exhaustion from heat, less crowds and a glorious sunset at the top.  Happy Hiking my Dear Phoenicians."

When did your service start sucking? Hey every person that decided that my two top was not important enough to attend! Why did it take 10 minutes to order my drink and then an additional ten minutes to actually get my drink? By the way, Tiger beer is on your menu.

4,"This place has been around forever. I started coming here when I was 5 or 6, especially when my grandpa came to town from Cincinnati. He loved it.  The whole ""wild west"" theme prevails, and it is fun to think about cowboys and times gone by. I liked the sasparilla when I was a kid, I dont think Ive ever had it anywhere else.  Last time I was in Phoenix we went again, and while the quality of the food has maybe slid a bit since I was 5 ( um, Im kinda a LOT older now), it is still cool. I like the good mood of all the visitors, its a place that inspires laughter and happy shared experience.  If you do wear a tie, wear one you dont care about, ok. Trust me on this."

1,"The organization is grand with a ton of selection but the employees could care less about costumer service.  It is very amazing with the amount of unemployed people in the city they have to hire the most incompetent individuals....  Im not going to be ignorant and say they are ALL bad, but a few in the bunch seem to make it difficult to be a repeat costumer.  Try talking to a manager at this location and you will be routed around the store till you finally get some one that states ""the manager is off till next week.""  i will stay a website purchaser until they change their policy at this location and hire individuals with a better standard"

2,to make a long story short --- we had a coupon for this place.  We know its an ASU hang out but the coupon was for spend 50.00 get 25.00 off.  Ok service was not good --- when we got the bill the pizza and wings were charged separate -- not right -- it was a together order per the menu.  We had a pitcher of beer and a single beer plus food -- bill was almost 70.00 -- we gave the waitress the coupon -- she had to change the bill for the pizza and wings --- then she came back and stated the coupon had a 18% gratuity and service charge of 13.59.  Based on what ???  that actually ate up the coupon and we ended up paying full price anyway.  Never again --- and the food was fair --- not a good place to return to -- ASU take it away -- its all yours -----

5,"This is the most progressive, inclusive, welcoming, diverse, intellectually stimulating, public-service oriented church in the Valley, if not the West Coast.  Weve been to more than a few and can attest to that.   Pastor Jeff not only knows everyones name but is genuinely concerned about everything that goes on in your life.  The congregation is like one big family.  Love for your neighbors is not just a commandment at this church - its acted upon.   If youre sick of churches that tell you what to believe in and dont act what they preach, youd better check this one out.  Services every Sunday at 9:30am."

2,"So everyone in Old Town has been waiting for a good sports bar forever. When everyone heard Thunder Dan was coming to town the excitement starting buzzing. Well this time Thunder Dan didnt hit this buzzer beater. First off it does get two stars for a reason so lets start there. The atmosphere is great. The venue is super cool and there is tons of tvs.  Thats pretty much where it stops. The food isnt great and is relatively slow. I have had a burger, wings, the chicken quesadilla and a couple of other things which didnt impress me. Plus the service was super slow... This kind of reminds me of the Suns-Bulls series super exciting but just misses the mark of greatness. I am sticking with my old faithful two blocks away Zipps."

5,"WOW!!! A real European bakery!  This was awesome, after having lunch next door at La Buona Pasta we took home some kalachis and walnut roll home for later.  The cakes are varied and everything looks buttery good and sweet.  Having grown up near a Swedish bakery it kind of remind me of that--donuts, cakes, cheesecakes, breads and other European specialties.  The shop is also set up with a small section of Polish-centric groceries.  mmmm maybe I will have to learn to cook some Polish dishes.  Next special occasion my cake is coming from there.  :-) The one we visited is  13331 W. Indian School Rd. Litchfield Park, AZ 85340 USA 623-547-4655"

2,"I was so disappointed in this place. I just moved out here and was craving filipino food and found this place based on reviews. Although the reviews were average, I was hoping to catch this place on one of its good days. Nope, not the case.  The place is not much to look at and the food did not look good. I was hesitant to eat here but was so hungry and saw that they had my fav dishes, sinigang and diniguan. They were both ok, Ive def had better. I ordered the pancit for my husband and it was terrible! He had maybe two bites and threw the rest away.  Oh well, wont be coming back here. Theres another filipino place in Phoenix so well be trying that next. Gingeroot, also in Chandler, is way better but expensive. Guess its worth the price when you have your cravings!"

There is a Banner Pet hospital, and there is a Grooming station ,as well as a Dog training store as well. Talk about your one stop shopping. I even got to hold a beautiful baby girl Pug just 6 weeks old. She was absolutly adorable.   We took a picture but have not figured out how to download it yet. Nice and Clean all throughout the store . We purchased a few items and then we were on our way.  Lots of Parking in the lot. Plus nice clean human bathrooms."

Plus nice clean human bathrooms."
5,"We made a last minute decision to go out on New Years Eve.  The restaurant was very busy but after just a few minutes a couple of seats opened at the bar ( our favorite place to sit) and the bar tenders, Blake, Kennan and Clair were ON IT!  They were very busy, but did not miss a new face at the bar or a glass writing for a refill.  The food was excellent. My husband had the baseball steak with twice baked potato and I had Prime Rib  with lobster tail and twice baked potato. Everything was cooked to perfection. Oh yes! Start with the garlic cheese bread as it is yummy!"

2,"Would normally give this place 4 stars as I have been a regular here for about a year.  Cheap drinks, great crowd and great music. Except I had my first bad experience here the other sunday.  Granted, me and all the other people from my work were pretty loud after a sunday afternoon spring training game.  Maybe it was the girls being a little too giggly or us just having too much fun for a dive bar...but I think none of that warrants the bartender calling us cheap and rude.  Come on now, we are all servers and we all tipped you well.  Whats with the attitude?  Will still continue to come to this place once I stave off the embarrassment of telling people from work I know about this cool bar only to be so rudely treated by a way too snobby for a sunday afternoon bartender."

1,Donuts are worst Ive ever had. I bought 2 dozen donuts using their 10.99 sale and it was the worst donuts I have ever had in my life. All the donuts were dry and stale. I should have gone a couple of miles over and bought Krispy Kreme. Krispy Kreme donuts are always fresh. These ones were worst that those that sat on the shelf for a week in a supermarket!

4,"stumbled in craving breakfast because it very close to airport and very close to the Aloft hotel I was staying at.  Yes, I am a and yes, I am from a part of the US where cowboys are common, so walking into a place full of country western paraphanalia made me.  The service good, the food was delicious, and I walked out with a few good photos.  The coffee a tad bit weak, but Im a starbucks bold drinker, so I dont hold it against them."

4,My wife and I ate here when we were in town for the B&J auto auction.  The food was good and affordable.  We liked the fact that they had a full bar and we were able to have a couple of tasty Margaritas.  Staff was friendly overall we had a good dining experience.

1,"Every time Ive been there they have messed up my order in some way. The first time I ordered a sonic blast w Carmel. They charged me for Carmel but there was none in it plus the bottom of the cup was busted and my ice cream was leaking out. The next I went I ordered a reese sonic blast and a snickers, they were both snickers. Very upset I havent been back and I love that place."

4,"One of my new favorite neighborhood bars!  We had a Canada Day shindig here and its a great little neighborhood bar with fair drink prices and super friendly bar staff. Youd never know that theres a bar inside when you get to the parking lot behind the Ice Rink - just look for the signs on the top of the building.  They have lots of TVs for hockey fans and the bar looks right out onto the ice so you can watch people skate. They had a great jukebox and the Rockband kit so you can rock out with all your newest bar friends.  For food selection you have BBQ, BBQ, or BBQ...either beef, pork, or chicken, with a side for $6.50. Tasty stuff! Great beer selection including Molson Canadian or Labatt Blue."

5,"The message I received was drip is toast. I dont drink coffee... a terrible character fault, I know... but Gina and her partner are wonderful hosts and have made a cozy little space to serve delicious food and drinks (I get the chai tea with soy milk.) I like that computers are no where to be seen, only happy people eating and drinking and enjoying conversation. This is a lovely little place, a gem. I enjoy every visit. It is especially nice to bring new people in that havent been before (so invite a friend to brunch because it is a nice surprise.) The service is great, the food is made fresh, and everything Ive tried is delicious, even my five year old loved her nutella on toast. Good things come in small packages and toast illustrates this perfectly."

2,"First time experience. Tried turkey burger from the skinyalicous menu. Burger was ok but greasy. They served me a salad that has gone bad.  You donot serve a salad with rotting vegetables. Also Shepard pie we ordered had extra ingredients such as zuccini, so they should have warned us about not being a proper Shepard pie.  Gordon Ramsay would have been mad.  Service was good. Only saving grace."

The guy was not friendly and just wanted our money even though he did not do his job! I would NEVER recommend this company to anyone. We paid $1000 and got $20 worth of service. I mopped the floor the day after the cleaning guy was here and got a lot of the ""staining as he would say"" off easily. I have included a picture that we wrote in the floor with a paper towel after the cleaning....can you read the saying? That is exctaly how we felt after the service. REALLY?!?!?"

We were then informed that we couldnt order dinner. Maybe when they see someone coming in and telling them they are...here for dinner...they might give them a heads up that the kitchen Is closing so we can order our meals and not be told five minutes after it did close..fourth time weve given this place a and got crappy service. Bartender got a buck tip and we had to go find another restaurant for dinner, Needless to say we wont be giving them another chance. Not good Gordon B. Not good."

Generally stopping by for slices is the easiest way to find good service with little to no wait.  Not always the friendliest workers, but that doesnt make my pizza take longer or taste any different!"

3,"Food was good, I had the Frutti de Mare with red sauce and boy it is spicy, so be warned. Everyone else ordered the Spaghetti Pie, which was the special that night. It was OK, my moms is better. The service was good, but the wait for a table was over an hour. Of course if was a Saturday night and they are having Glendale Glitters so it was really busy. The pizza is good, I have had it before, I am not the biggest wood fire pizza fan, because it is always burned on the bottom!"

2,"Would normally give this place 4 stars as I have been a regular here for about a year.  Cheap drinks, great crowd and great music. Except I had my first bad experience here the other sunday.  Granted, me and all the other people from my work were pretty loud after a sunday afternoon spring training game.  Maybe it was the girls being a little too giggly or us just having too much fun for a dive bar...but I think none of that warrants the bartender calling us cheap and rude.  Come on now, we are all servers and we all tipped you well.  Whats with the attitude?  Will still continue to come to this place once I stave off the embarrassment of telling people from work I know about this cool bar only to be so rudely treated by a way too snobby for a sunday afternoon bartender."

1,"Wow! I cant believe this place gets so many good reviews.  I was hauled here once by co-workers looking for a cheap meal. But, how much value does your lunch dollar have when you dont even want to eat the food? Dry and sticky rice; ""white meat chicken"" unidientifiable as such, and a sweet glaze that provided the only flavor. Quite frankly, it was disgusting, and none of the dishes my co-workers had looked any better (though they seemed to be fine with them). I should know to stay away from restaurants that have pictures of their menu items on the wall. The one star is only for the fast and friendly service."

2,"I read the two good reviews here on Yelp, so I was looking forward to a good Italian dinner.  Unfortunately, it must have been an off night.  The waitress didnt want to be bothered and the meatballs and the tomato sauce on the spaghetti didnt have much flavor.  Thats the test of a good Italian restaurant for me.  If the sauce is good, they usually get thumbs up.  This sauce wasnt ""bad,"" but it was bland and watery.  Even the bowl of spaghetti wasnt drained properly so there was a dripping, runny mess at the bottom of the paltry bowl of pasta.  This place is right around the corner from my house and Dominic is my brothers name!  So I was really disappointed."

5,"In my opinion, one of the best steakhouses in town.  My husband and I go here for all our special occasions and have never had one bad meal.  The service is the best just like their steaks.  I recommend the Caesar salad, fillet, creamed spinach, cream corn, garlic and lobster mashed potatoes.  We will continue our tradition and keep coming back here."
