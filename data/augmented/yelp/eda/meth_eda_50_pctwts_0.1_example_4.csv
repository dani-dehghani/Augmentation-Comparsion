2,"Would normally give this place 4 stars as I have been a regular here for about a year.  Cheap drinks, great crowd and great music. Except I had my first bad experience here the other sunday.  Granted, me and all the other people from my work were pretty loud after a sunday afternoon spring training game.  Maybe it was the girls being a little too giggly or us just having too much fun for a dive bar...but I think none of that warrants the bartender calling us cheap and rude.  Come on now, we are all servers and we all tipped you well.  Whats with the attitude?  Will still continue to come to this place once I stave off the embarrassment of telling people from work I know about this cool bar only to be so rudely treated by a way too snobby for a sunday afternoon bartender."

1,"First off, the restaurant is dim and dark.. I thought the decor was a little off because they were going for a tropical Vietnam theme with banana trees in there and a waterfall fountain. The waiter there did not have a smile and didnt seem freindly, it looked like this was the last place he wanted to be at. The service sucked ass. I mean come on, there was only two tables including mines and 3.9/4 of the time, he didnt check up on us or refilled our water and we had to walk up to ask for our bill.. like seriously...? Are you that lazy. Bun Bo Hue was skimpy on the meat and had little veggies on the side. Pho had a rancid smell. Noodles in my sisters bun thit nuong were hard and watery (seemed like they were super old) Overall, I wouldnt recommend to ANYBODY."

The Ravioli di Zucca Appetizer (see pics) which is: roasted butternut squash ravioli with parmesan, brown butter, sage and crumbled amaretti...OMG it was just delicious but a perfect appetizer to share , its available in two sizes I got the small one. The sweetness from the crumbled amaretti is a very nice touch. I ordered the Healthy Fish again (see pics) and once again it was perfect! My guest ordered the Penne Salsiccia (see pics) which had Italian sausage, caramelized onions and pecorino cheese! The sausage was really good and for just $5 you cant beat that!"

2,"I had high hopes for this restaurant, but to be honest, it let me down.  The wild mushroom and goat cheese salad was phenomenal.  From there it was downhill.  Great ambiance, though I think they are trying too hard to be a steakhouse.   Most importantly though...  Given it is a seafood restaurant, they sure didnt know how to cook my fish.  It was fried and oily (and was not marketed that way on the menu!)  I wanted something light and left feeling like I ate a ton of bricks.  My friends scallops - she said they were ""okay"" and not better than that. Oh, and the prices are set as if it were a steakhouse too. (Note: if it were, which its not.) Mediocre at best."

Really, the TC cakes were just cakes... No flavor, no texture, dry... And I cant say how impressed I was that the clerk shoved all my selections into one, tiny, flat bag meant for cookies or sandwiches!  Apparently presentation and flavor preservation mean nothing...

2,What a lame store.  The employees didnt say hi to me once and were totally unhelpful.  Their dog food selection is decent but their dog toy selection is worse than PetSmart.

4,"Ordered the King Carlos IV.  It was HUGE, two of us ate half of it.  I thought it would be smaller than that.  It had all the major meats plus hotdogs, cheeses, and a siracha type sauce.  I think this was featured in diners, drive-ins, and dives.  It was very good but just wow huge.  It came with a side of ruffled chips.  Very nice people.  The fruit smoothies were good the horchata decent but not the best Ive had.  Great bang for your buck though.  Id go again and try something a bit more sensibly sized. There was a wait of about 15 minutes or so.  Very popular on a Saturday for lunch :)"

The salad was crisp and dressing was on the side, which I appreciated.   On my way out I got a chocolate chip cookie that was OK. I love cookies and they have to be pretty bad for me not to like them. This one, I kid you not, must have had maybe 3-4 chocolate chips?

You better know what you need and where to find it when you go here because it is easy to get lost and there are no Jo-Ann Sherpas to get you back."

2,"So everyone in Old Town has been waiting for a good sports bar forever. When everyone heard Thunder Dan was coming to town the excitement starting buzzing. Well this time Thunder Dan didnt hit this buzzer beater. First off it does get two stars for a reason so lets start there. The atmosphere is great. The venue is super cool and there is tons of tvs.  Thats pretty much where it stops. The food isnt great and is relatively slow. I have had a burger, wings, the chicken quesadilla and a couple of other things which didnt impress me. Plus the service was super slow... This kind of reminds me of the Suns-Bulls series super exciting but just misses the mark of greatness. I am sticking with my old faithful two blocks away Zipps."

Its just up the road from Yogurtland. Anyway, the single star says it all... ""Eek! Methinks not."""

I can only comment on the food, as we ordered take out.  Our order was ready in 15 minutes and it was complete.   I had Chow Fun, and it was the equivalent to Flos, Ok, but not spectacular, and a lot more oily.  Husband had Mongolian Beef and said that Flos was better, but the meat tasted fresher on the Jade Palace version.  Jade Palace is much closer to us, so I will try their Hot and Sour soup in the fall, which is usually the barometer I use to measure Chinese Food.  Go figure, we are now hoping for some San Francisco restaurants to relocate to Scottsdale."

2,"When I was younger and first moved to Arizona, Serranos on Rural Road became a family tradition to get mexican food. It was basically all I knew till adulthood. If I would have reviewed this place 10 years ago, it would have been 5 stars but now the blinders are off and I have money to try better places. One by one they all seem to dwarf Serranos in most every way. I feel kinda guilty writing this and hope my family does not read this :) But it has to be said. I would still eat at Serranos but it doesnt have the same feeling anymore. The Chimichangas are good and their bean dip is awesome. Nothing I have had is gross or anything but its just   basic greasy mexican food. There are better places out there. Once again to any family reading this....Im sorry :)"

I feel kinda guilty writing this and hope family does not read :) But it has to be. I would still eat at Serranos but it doesnt have the same feeling anymore. The Chimichangas are good their bean dip is awesome. Nothing I have had is gross or anything but its   basic greasy mexican. There are better places there. Once again to any family reading this.... sorry :)"

5,"Ah what a beauty and wonder Camelback mountain is. However I do warn beginners to use the easier trail on the East side near Invergorden which runs north south and turns into 64th st. It is a bit of a walk from the parking through the neighborhood but the hike is less treacherous and much easier and takes you up a gradual slope to the top. Be very careful its easy to loose the trail on that side too.  Of course all the Phoenicians like to go to Echo Canyon at Mcdonald and 44th street bend. Parking can be bad at peak times on weekends--I definetely recommend late afternoon hiking, less exhaustion from heat, less crowds and a glorious sunset at the top.  Happy Hiking my Dear Phoenicians."

1,"When I was growing up we called this the canal. In other parts of town it is still called the canal. In some places people actually fish from it. I think they die right after they eat their catch, which is why you dont see them very often. Over the years you periodically hear about dead bodies being found in the canal as well.  Google it. What is so annoying about this is that Scottsdale, is trying to make it seem like this isnt the same heinous canal thats always been there. When I heard about the development around the Scottsdale Waterfront, I couldnt figure out what they were talking about. What water? Then I started cracking up when I found out it was the canal. Come on Scottsdale, you can put a dress and lipstick on a pig, but it is still a pig. You are not fooling anyone."

Sure, its a man-made water source, and yes - its pretty nasty if you plan on swimming inside Tempe Town Lake, but its gorgeous during the day and at night too! Ive done a handful of triathlons that started and ended at Tempe Beach Park, and most recently, I did the PetSmart Walk (go team Yelp) that took place at the park as well...  With the proximity of the park to ASU / Mill Ave, it really is a fun place to go hang for an afternoon - no matter whats going on there... My only words of wisdom - dont swallow the lake water!"

The first time the torta came with chips and the 2nd time they came alone.  For 6 or 7 bucks Id expect a little more.

1,"Wow! I cant believe this place gets so many good reviews.  I was hauled here once by co-workers looking for a cheap meal. But, how much value does your lunch dollar have when you dont even want to eat the food? Dry and sticky rice; ""white meat chicken"" unidientifiable as such, and a sweet glaze that provided the only flavor. Quite frankly, it was disgusting, and none of the dishes my co-workers had looked any better (though they seemed to be fine with them). I should know to stay away from restaurants that have pictures of their menu items on the wall. The one star is only for the fast and friendly service."

4,"I usually hate chains, especially Italian ones like Olive Garden and Romanos. But I was pleasantly surprised my Maggianos. We went because we got a gift card for Christmas but we are probably going back.  The bread and the dipping oil they start you out with is pretty good.

I really liked my eggplant Parmesan. It is the best egg parm I have had at a chain. The sauce is fresh tasting which huge chunks of garlic. One nice surprise is that our server said that my dish qualified for a free take home dish of the same category. So I ordered the gnocchi and had a nice dinner the next day."

My stylist, Delia, ran 45 minutes late to start me, and on several occasions during the hair cut, stopped and kept looking around.  She made various odd faces as if to say my hair was a mess.  She not only didnt listen to what I wanted, but shot down the only thing I did ask for.  She said I wouldnt look good.  At the end of the painful ordeal, she then charged me for a conditioning service I didnt ask for.  At that point she directed me to the line at the front of the store, after which I waited in, they then sent me back to the salon to make the price correction.

3,"I like the Thai Hut because it is safe Thai eating. They have some of the more adventurous authentic Thai, and then they have what I ALWAYS get - The Garden Delight with beef. Just basically vegetables and beef cooked in a marinade. They always have plenty of servers on hand and Ive never been disappointed. Theres just some little sparkle that it seems to be missing. I struggled between giving it a 3 or a 4, but I settled on a 3 because they could definitely improve the atmosphere a little bit and parking sucks. They are really close to the light rail now though, just get off at McDowell/Central and walk one block east on McDowell."

5,"This review is for locals...the Hyatt isnt just a beautiful spot to stay it, its also a perfect spot to just sit and enjoy the day! Ive done this several times, many times for dinner and drinks afterward on the patio. Most recently, I decided to set up shop and do some work from one of the comfy chairs on the outdoor patio which allowed me to enjoy the gorgeous Arizona weather and still get some work done. They do an excellent job of making the hotel amenities comfortable and welcoming.  For hotel guests, if you are planning to stay here, be sure to look into staying in one of the rooms that sit on the man made lake. They have great patios right on the water so when you wake up, you could have breakfast on the lake! It doesnt get much better than that."

Maybe that makes me a coffee snob, I am not sure."

3,Met up with a group of friends here on a Monday night... a big group. Although Keegans had no notice of our mob arrival they did well with service etc. Beers were poured fast; food took a little extra time but with a group our size that is to be expected. The outside patio space was great on a warm AZ night... a friend got the sliders and said they were quite tasty when they finally arrived. The happy hour prices are okay with a nice choice of beers and mixed cocktails.

3,This theatre is very conveniently located in the Arrowhead mall which of course makes parking a breeze.

2,"I heard nothing but praise about the food and atmosphere of this chain restaurant.  I loved the look of this place inside and out. Great rustic barrels and old barber chairs in the bar area gave a unique look. Service was friendly and fast.  Food was less than desirable. Salad was nothing but iceberg lettuce (and I got a stump) with some shredded red cabbage. My pasta dish was spaghetti with a white clam sauce. It was too salty and there was a sprinkling of microscopic clam bits.  I always take leftovers home, this time I didnt. While the prices are good its not worth a less than average meal. Husband was equally disappointed with his chicken marsala. Chances of going back are slim to none."

I LOVE the fact that each dish is mildly spiced, and left up to the individual to customize the flavor depending on which sauces they choose.  Im a spicy lightweight so it was great that I didnt have to worry about getting something too hot to enjoy. I had a bowl of brown rice, cumin potatoes and tofu masala with a cool yogurt-cucumber-mint sauce on the side.  It was fantastic!  I cant wait to go back. ...also, I thought it was adorable that we were given a golden dollar coin with our check for ""making the drive to their location and to compensate for high-gas prices"".

2,This Baja Fresh really didnt impress me.  Its pricey considering that all youre getting is meat in a tortilla.  It doesnt have that Mexican feel to it and is unoriginal.

There are better Mexican food places to go to.

The yogurt tastes great, is light and refreshing and somewhat healthy if you avoid all of the chocolately/candy toppings yet they offer tons of fruit options. Priced by weight, a great stop after retail therapy at Saks or dessert after Stingray Sushi or True Food at the Biltmore. A must try, plus they have punch cards for free fro yo after a couple of visits! :)"

3,"This place was good, just not as good as I had hoped based on the reviews.  I would have given the place 3 1/2.  Since I cant, I decided to balance out another reviewer who gave the place 4 stars but also thought it deserved 3 1/2. Positive notes:  Hot sauce had some bite to it, chips were good, Camarones culichi had a wonderful sauce.  Lots of fresh limes served with the meal.  Full bar. Not-so-positive notes:  Shrimp in the Camarones culichi was overcooked (cardinal sin for a seafood place).  The shrimp coctail was just ok - good sized boiled shrimp, but not too much flavor.   If driving by and hungry I would stop in again, but not if I have to drive too far out of the way."

The 1st time we tried the Duce I was extremely let down by the customer service. The parking is atrocious. Its as if you are inconveniencing the staff by asking where you order food. They were out of just about everything we wanted to order. So disappointing.  However I decided to give them a second shot. Everyone has a rough night. We went to an event there last night the entertainment by Scandalesque was AMAZING... same TERRIBLE customer service from the staff at the Duce. Management needs to wake up. Great concept. Horrific customer service and staff.

I know I know, its a chain... and maybe I just have high expectations, being that Im from back east where we have small family-run Greek restaurants on every corner."

5,"Thanks to Yelp I was able to find this hidden jewel.  The place looks like a spanish style motel converted into a restaurant.  With a cute garden in the back.  I had already eaten so didnt intend on a 2nd breakfast.  But stingy GF only allowed me a few bites so I had to ask Chris to whip up  another plate for me.   It was my first time having chilled salmon done that way and it was so good.  Everything tasted so fresh.   For the price you get to drink all you want.  And I must have had at least 10 glasses of the orange juice with mixed berries.   The food and the atmosphere reminds me of eating in Napa, CA.   Will definitely return when Im in town."

Since I cant, I decided to balance out another reviewer who gave the place 4 stars but also thought it deserved 3 1/2. Positive notes:  Hot sauce had some bite to it, chips were good, Camarones culichi had a wonderful sauce.  Lots of fresh limes served with the meal.  Full bar. Not-so-positive notes:  Shrimp in the Camarones culichi was overcooked (cardinal sin for a seafood place).  The shrimp coctail was just ok - good sized boiled shrimp, but not too much flavor.

2,This pizza always tasted great but lately I feel like they have cheapened their ingredients. I realize its $5 pizza but it just tastes different to me now. If it werent for the flavored crust I would not come back.  But the main reason I have not returned to Hungry Howies is because the last time I wanted to place a pick up order I was turned down. I asked for a reason and was told that they received a very large company order and they were not taking regular orders at that moment.  Youd think they would be able to accommodate everyone even if a large order was placed.

I took a sip squeezed the lemon, and thought there was something wrong with the taste.  I checked and at first thought it was a lemon seed but no, sure enough it was a cricket (in which i took a picture).  The way this restaurant handled an insect in my water was repulsive.  One of the male bartenders came over and brought a new water saying, ""It happens.""  No, sorry thats disgusting.  If i hadnt been craving the volcano chicken I went there for I would have just left.  And then on top of getting a cricket in my water theres no discount or compensation off of my bill."

1,"I used to go here at least 3 times a week for Happy hour.  The volcano chicken was was favorite meal.  However, the last time I was in there I had a cricket in my water.  I took a sip squeezed the lemon, and thought there was something wrong with the enough.  I checked and at first thought And was an lemon seed but no, sure taste it my a cricket (in which i took a picture).  The way this restaurant handled a insect in my water was repulsive.

Great rustic barrels and old barber chairs in the bar area gave a unique look. Service was friendly and fast.  Food was less than desirable. Salad was nothing but iceberg lettuce (and I got a stump) with some shredded red cabbage. My pasta dish was spaghetti with a white clam sauce. It was too salty and there was a sprinkling of microscopic clam bits.  I always take leftovers home, this time I didnt. While the prices are good its not worth a less than average meal. Husband was equally disappointed with his chicken marsala. Chances of going back are slim to none."

In the last two years the boyfriend and I have eaten at this restaurant location quite often. For the money, you get exactly what you pay for: a decent meal and generous portions. The chips and salsa are ever-flowing and the salsa is some of the best Ive tasted. The wait staff are generally pleasant, attentive and very accommodating. Plus they frequently recall what you had during your previous visits. I recommend you try the Machaca dinner or my boyfriends favorite dish, the number 5 lunch special. There are multiple locations in the valley, but this one beats them all hands down."

It felt to me like this hotel was trying to be a hotel that you would find in vegas.  the rooms are overpriced, there is no storage in them and they give you like 5 hangers total.  The water here is awful so dont drink it.  The pool area is nice, and the room service is very quick.  So those aspects of this hotel are nice.

2,"Would normally give this place 4 stars as I have been a regular here for about a year.  Cheap drinks, great crowd and great music. Except I had my first bad experience here the other sunday.  Granted, me and all the other people from my work were pretty loud after a sunday afternoon spring training game.  Maybe it was the girls being a little too giggly or us just having too much fun for a dive bar...but I think none of that warrants the bartender calling us cheap and rude.  Come on now, we are all servers and we all tipped you well.  Whats with the attitude?  Will still continue to come to this place once I stave off the embarrassment of telling people from work I know about this cool bar only to be so rudely treated by a way too snobby for a sunday afternoon bartender."

Thanks to Lindsey and Yelp, I had the opportunity to go and the performance was just stunning.

The bartenders we bought our drinks from, was very friendly and accomodating.  I cant say enough about how beautiful the performance was from the dancers, the sets, the costumes, etc. Just incredible. I may just take my daughter to see it with me this season...."

As many reviewers have already mentioned, the cupcake is also over-priced at $3.75 each for the size and the lack of creativity.  With so many desert/snack places in Scottsdale, I am unlikely to come back here."

Im not a huge fan of their food but its always busy so clearly other people dont have my same opinion. The three stars is for the service, they were super attentive and everything was taken care of for our party. I just dont think the cheesecake is that great, Im sorry! But the apps arent too bad."

1,"My husband and I have Been meaning to go in here and see if it was anything like hong kong gourmet, so yesterday for lunch we decided to give it a try. Huge mistake! The food was literally inedible, everything was either too cold or burnt to a char, nothing tasted good. We decided to try the desert and the cream puff (Im unsure how you can mess that up) was petrified and the cream was so gross I spit it out. The smell of the flan actually made us gag, we had such an awful time I complained to the manager. She didnt even seem to care, and gave us 20% off of a lunch we didnt even eat. We were disgusted by this place, and we will never, ever go back. Dont do it, you will regret it!"
