2,"Would normally give this place 4 stars as I have been a regular here for about a year.  Cheap drinks, great crowd and great music. Except I had my first bad experience here the other sunday.  Granted, me and all the other people from my work were pretty loud after a sunday afternoon spring training game.  Maybe it was the girls being a little too giggly or us just having too much fun for a dive bar...but I think none of that warrants the bartender calling us cheap and rude.  Come on now, we are all servers and we all tipped you well.  Whats with the attitude?  Will still continue to come to this place once I stave off the embarrassment of telling people from work I know about this cool bar only to be so rudely treated by a way too snobby for a sunday afternoon bartender."

2,"Had a very disappointing experience today.  All quartet in our group were disappointed in the quality of the food, especially the overripe cantaloupe and torpid potatoes.  The office was busy which wont be the case much longer if they dont improve their fare.  The service staff was favorable although I thought it interesting that no one asked us about our feel.   If they were concerned, now they know."

With so many desert/snack places in Scottsdale, I am unlikely to come back here."

Sure, its a man-made water source, and yes - its pretty nasty if you plan on swimming inside Tempe Town Lake, but its gorgeous during the day and at night too!

2,to make a long story short --- we had a coupon for this place.  We know its an ASU hang out but the coupon was for spend 50.00 get 25.00 off.  Ok service was not good --- when we got the bill the pizza and wings were charged separate -- not right -- it was a together order per the menu.  We had a pitcher of beer and a single beer plus food -- bill was almost 70.00 -- we gave the waitress the coupon -- she had to change the bill for the pizza and wings --- then she came back and stated the coupon had a 18% gratuity and service charge of 13.59.  Based on what ???  that actually ate up the coupon and we ended up paying full price anyway.  Never again --- and the food was fair --- not a good place to return to -- ASU take it away -- its all yours -----

1,"Have been an Ulta customer for a long time, but had never tried the salon until recently.  Was a HORRIBLE experience.  My stylist, Delia, ran 45 minutes late to start me, and on several occasions during the hair cut, stopped and kept looking around.  She made various odd faces as if to say my hair was a mess.  She not only didnt listen to what I wanted, but shot down the only thing I did ask for.  She said I wouldnt look good.  At the end of the painful ordeal, she then charged me for a conditioning service I didnt ask for.  At that point she directed me to the line at the front of the store, after which I waited in, they then sent me back to the salon to make the price correction.  (happened twice, then I asked for a manager)  Was very unprofessional all around and would NEVER go back!!!"

The service is great, the food is made fresh, and everything Ive tried is delicious, even my five year old loved her nutella on toast. Good things come in small packages and toast illustrates this perfectly."

It is very amazing with the amount of unemployed people in the city they have to hire the most incompetent individuals....  Im not going to be ignorant and say they are ALL bad, but a few in the bunch seem to make it difficult to be a repeat costumer.  Try talking to a manager at this location and you will be routed around the store till you finally get some one that states ""the manager is off till next week.""  i will stay a website purchaser until they change their policy at this location and hire individuals with a better standard"

3,"I finally tried Spicy Pickle last week. I like the name and was intrigued about their menu. Paninis, soups, salads, pizzetas, nothing out of the ordinary. I had a half sandwich ( Sausalito Bandido?), half salad combo ( Spinach salad). Food was fresh and good. The sandwich could have stand a little more meat, it was truly flat. The salad was crisp and dressing was on the side, which I appreciated.   On my way out I got a chocolate chip cookie that was OK. I love cookies and they have to be pretty bad for me not to like them. This one, I kid you not, must have had maybe 3-4 chocolate chips? So if youre craving chocolate, this is not the cookie for you."

2,"I personally will never eat there again. The chips are actually amazing though, I would eat those a lot if it didnt require me stpping foot in the ultimate bro/slut restaurant. The food is gross, the tortillas are ok, I like the decor actually, but the employees are slutty (and by slutty I saw skirts soo short if they picked something off the floor you for sure would see vagina) Apparently the uniform is jean skirts and heels. This is the male glittery shirt wearing capitol of Scottsdale. The food sucks, dont eat here!"

2,"Would normally give this place 4 stars as I have been a regular here for about a year.  Cheap drinks, great crowd and great music. Except I had my first bad experience here the other sunday.  Granted, me and all the other people from my work were pretty loud after a sunday afternoon spring training game.  Maybe it was the girls being a little too giggly or us just having too much fun for a dive bar...but I think none of that warrants the bartender calling us cheap and rude.  Come on now, we are all servers and we all tipped you well.  Whats with the attitude?  Will still continue to come to this place once I stave off the embarrassment of telling people from work I know about this cool bar only to be so rudely treated by a way too snobby for a sunday afternoon bartender."

3,This theatre is very conveniently located in the Arrowhead mall which of course makes parking a breeze. It isnt my favorite in town because there always seem to be tons of teenagers here (im sure BECAUSE it is in the mall) and yes I know if they are too loud then we are too old. In any case the theatres are busy and bustling. The concessions seem very high but I guess that is a trade-off for the convenience.

2,"I was so disappointed in this place. I just moved out here and was craving filipino food and found this place based on reviews. Although the reviews were average, I was hoping to catch this place on one of its good days. Nope, not the case.  The place is not much to look at and the food did not look good. I was hesitant to eat here but was so hungry and saw that they had my fav dishes, sinigang and diniguan. They were both ok, Ive def had better. I ordered the pancit for my husband and it was terrible! He had maybe two bites and threw the rest away.  Oh well, wont be coming back here. Theres another filipino place in Phoenix so well be trying that next. Gingeroot, also in Chandler, is way better but expensive. Guess its worth the price when you have your cravings!"

I was hesitant to eat here one was so hungry and saw that they had my fav dishes, sinigang and diniguan. They were both ok, Ive def two better. I ordered the pancit for my husband and it was terrible! He had maybe had bites and threw moved rest away.  filipino well, wont be coming back here. Theres another filipino place in Phoenix so well be trying that next. Gingeroot, also in Chandler, is way better but so. Guess its worth the price when you just your cravings!"

The current staff is incredibly immature and act like children yelling, and even barking, at high decibels.  Ive never seen anything like  it anywhere.  Ill have to think twice about coming back if this continues."
